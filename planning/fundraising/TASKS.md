### 💡 SaaStr / Jason Lemkin (2025-2026 Reality Check)

**Critical insight:** "Most binary fundraising environment in our lifetimes. You're either getting funded or you ain't."

| Topic | Takeaway |
|-------|----------|
| **AI is essential** | No AI = no funding at expected valuations |
| **Growth bar raised** | 75% growth (2021 standard) won't cut it |
| **Efficiency expected** | $50-100M ARR with <100 employees is the new bar |
| **Ask your investors** | "What are the exact odds we can raise?" Push for a number. |
