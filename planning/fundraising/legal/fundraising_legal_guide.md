# Fundraising Legal Guide

Based on Geoff Ralston's advice (YC Partner, "Fundraising Fundamentals")

## Use Standard Forms

**Use the YC Post-Money SAFE** - not custom documents.

Why standard forms:
- **Short**: 3-5 pages (not 50-page contracts)
- **Cheap**: Minimal lawyer fees (maybe just a quick review)
- **Fast**: Investors understand them immediately, no negotiation
- **Proven**: Used by thousands of startups

**Official YC SAFE documents:**
https://www.ycombinator.com/documents

Download the Post-Money SAFE (not the old Pre-Money version). Most common for pre-seed/seed.

### Only 2 Things to Fill In

The YC SAFE is only 5 pages. You fill in:
1. **Amount** - How much they're investing
2. **Valuation Cap** - The maximum valuation for conversion (discounts are rarely used now)

That's it. Don't overcomplicate it.

### Use Clerky for Signing

Don't email Word docs back and forth. Use Clerky to generate and sign docs quickly:

Clerky handles the paperwork so you can focus on building.

## READ EVERY WORD

This is Ralston's biggest warning for founders.

**Even with standard forms:**
- Read every single word before signing
- Don't assume "standard" means "safe for you"
- Watch for modifications investors may have made
- Understand what "preferred provisions" mean

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Pro-rata rights (gives investors right to maintain ownership)
- MFN (Most Favored Nation) clauses
- Side letters with special terms
- Unusual valuation caps or discounts
- Board seat provisions at this stage

**If you don't understand something:**
- Ask your lawyer to explain in plain English
- Don't sign until you understand every clause
- "Nightmares come from signing terms you didn't read" - Ralston

## Company Structure

### C-Corp vs. LLC

**If you plan to raise multiple rounds, you need a C-Corp.**

LLCs are a "legal mess" for venture funding:
- Share redistribution is complicated
- Most VCs won't invest in LLCs
- Converting later is expensive and painful

### For US VC Raises: Delaware C Corporation

Most Silicon Valley VCs **require** Delaware C Corp:
- Standard structure they understand
- Clean cap table management
- Easy to add future investors
- Standard equity compensation (options, etc.)

### For Israeli Raises

Discuss with your lawyer:
- Israeli Ltd may work for local angels
- May need Delaware flip for US VCs later
- Tax implications differ
- Consider where you want to raise future rounds

**Action item:** Talk to a startup lawyer about optimal structure before closing any money.

## Budget for Milestones, Not Random Amounts

**Don't raise a random amount of money.**

Your runway must last long enough to:
1. Reach the next fundable milestone
2. PLUS a few extra months to actually close that next round

### The "Catch-22" Death Zone
Many startups die in the gap between:
- "Too late for pre-seed" (already built something)
- "Too early for seed" (not enough traction yet)

**Solution:** Plan your milestones and runway so you don't end up broke right after shipping but before proving traction.

### Explosive Growth Spending
VCs expect aggressive spending—often more than you make—to fuel rapid growth. Your financial model should reflect this. If you're optimizing for profitability, you're building a "lifestyle business," not a VC-backed startup.

## When to Get a Lawyer

**You don't need expensive lawyers for everything:**
- Standard SAFE: Can often sign without lawyer review
- Simple angel round: Quick review is enough

**You DO need a lawyer for:**
- Anything that's not a standard SAFE
- Priced rounds with term sheets
- Anything you don't fully understand
- When investor wants to modify standard terms
- Company incorporation setup

**Cost-saving tip:** Find a startup-focused lawyer who offers fixed-fee packages for early-stage companies.
