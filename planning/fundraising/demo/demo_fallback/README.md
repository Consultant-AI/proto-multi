# Demo Fallback Assets

Use these if the live demo fails. Pre-generated outputs that show what Proto can produce.

## Contents

| `sample_ad_variations.md` | 12 ad variations across LinkedIn, Google Search, Display |
| `sample_campaign_report.md` | Weekly performance report with analysis and recommendations |

## How to Use
