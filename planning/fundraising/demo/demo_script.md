# Proto Live Demo Script

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Goal:** Show Proto executing a complex, multi-step task that demonstrates the autonomous company capability

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (Before Call)

1. Open Proto with a fresh session
2. Have a sample project ready
3. Ensure cloud VM is provisioned and connected
4. Test that all tabs work: Files, Terminal, Browser, Computer

**Fallback:** If anything fails, switch to pre-recorded video in `demo/demo_fallback/`

**Note:** You can demo ANY complex task—the point is showing multi-agent coordination, multi-computer control, and the path to autonomy. Examples:
- Marketing campaign creation
- Building a simple SaaS feature
- Research and analysis report
- E-commerce product listing
- Content generation at scale

## Demo Script

### INTRO (30 seconds)

**[Show: Proto main interface with chat panel]**

> "This is Proto—infrastructure for autonomous companies. On the left is the agent chat where I give instructions. On the right, Proto has access to files, terminal, browser, and can control computers directly. Watch how it coordinates specialist agents to complete a complex task."

---

### PART 1: Task Delegation (60 seconds)

**[Click: Chat input]**

> "I'm going to give Proto a complex task—something that would normally require multiple specialists working together."

**[Type your chosen task, e.g.:]**
- Marketing: `Create a complete campaign for a B2B SaaS product. Research competitors, write ad copy, design landing page structure.`
- Development: `Build a simple API endpoint with tests. Research best practices, write the code, create documentation.`
- Research: `Analyze the market for AI coding assistants. Create a competitive landscape report with recommendations.`

**[Press Enter, then narrate as agents respond:]**

> "Watch what happens. The CEO agent analyzes this task and creates a plan. It's now breaking down the work and delegating to specialists..."

**[Point to agent tree/delegation flow:]**

> "This isn't one AI—it's specialist agents coordinating like a real organization. Each one is optimized for its specific task."

---

### PART 2: Multi-Computer Execution (60 seconds)

**[Click: Computers tab]**

> "Proto can control multiple computers simultaneously. Right now it's working on both my local machine and a cloud VM."

**[Show: Different work happening on different machines]**

> "One machine is doing research while another writes content. In a real autonomous company, this could be hundreds of machines working in parallel."

**[Click: Terminal tab]**

> "Full terminal access—it can run any command, execute scripts, deploy code, manage infrastructure."

**[Show a terminal command being executed]**

---

### PART 3: Output Generation (60 seconds)

**[Click: Files tab]**

> "Let's look at what it's produced."

**[Open generated files]**

> "Notice the quality—this isn't generic output. Each specialist agent produced work in their domain of expertise."

**[Open another file showing coordination]**

> "And see how the work connects together. The agents aren't working in isolation—they're coordinating, passing context, building on each other's output."

---

### PART 4: Approval Gates & Control (60 seconds)

**[Back to Chat, show the summary/report:]**

> "The CEO agent summarizes what was done and flags what needs human approval."

**[Point to approval gate in chat:]**

> "See this approval gate? Proto pauses here for human sign-off on anything sensitive—spending money, publishing externally, making trades, touching production systems."

> "The goal is to automate any human labor. When that's not possible, Proto uses hybrid models—it can hire people, delegate tasks, use humans as reviewers. Whatever model fits the task."

---

### CLOSE (30 seconds)

**[Show: Full interface again]**

> "What you just saw was a complex, multi-step process executed by coordinated AI agents across multiple computers."

> "This same architecture can run any computer-based business—agency work, e-commerce, content, trading, SaaS. Whatever works fastest."

> "Today it runs with approval gates. The goal is full automation—but when that's not possible, Proto can hire and manage people. That's the autonomous company factory."

**[Pause for questions]**

---

## Talking Points for Q&A

- **"How do you prevent mistakes?"** → Approval gates for key actions, audit logs for everything, kill switch for emergencies
- **"Why so many agents?"** → Specialization matters—a trader analyzes markets differently than a designer creates layouts. Just like real companies.
- **"What if the model hallucinates?"** → Verification loops, real execution (not just text), human review gates
- **"Why not just use ChatGPT/Claude directly?"** → Proto is built for orchestration—coordinating many agents, many computers, many tasks, self-improving. Single-model tools can't do that.
- **"What business will you run first?"** → Whatever works fastest. We'll experiment with agency work, content, e-commerce, trading—and double down on winners.

## Failure Recovery

| If This Fails | Do This |
|---------------|---------|
| Agent stuck | Say "Let me restart this agent" and refresh |
| Cloud VM disconnects | Switch to local demo only |
| Task takes too long | Jump to pre-saved files in `demo_fallback/` |
| Complete failure | Play pre-recorded video |

## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **Specialist agents** coordinating like a company
2. **Multi-computer** control (local + cloud)—scales to any size
3. **Self-improvement** — gets better with each task
4. **Approval gates** — human oversight that reduces over time
5. **Any business** — not limited to one domain
6. **Path to autonomy** — architecture is ready, reliability is the work
