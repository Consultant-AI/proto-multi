# Proto Live Demo Script

**Duration:** 5 minutes
**Goal:** Show Proto executing a complex, multi-step task that demonstrates the autonomous company capability

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (Before Call)

1. Open Proto with a fresh session
2. Have a sample project ready
3. Ensure cloud VM is provisioned and connected
4. Test that all tabs work: Files, Terminal, Browser, Computer

**Fallback:** If anything fails, switch to pre-recorded video in `demo/demo_fallback/`

**Note:** You can demo ANY complex task—the point is showing multi-agent coordination, cross-platform capability, and the path to autonomy. Examples:
- Marketing campaign creation
- Building a simple SaaS feature
- Research and analysis report
- E-commerce product listing
- Content generation at scale

## Demo Script

### INTRO (30 seconds)

**[Show: Proto main interface with chat panel]**

> "This is Proto—infrastructure for autonomous companies. On the left is the agent chat where I give instructions. On the right, Proto has access to files, terminal, browser, and can control computers directly. Watch how it coordinates specialist agents to complete a complex task."

---

### PART 1: Task Delegation (60 seconds)

**[Click: Chat input]**

> "I'm going to give Proto a complex task—something that would normally require multiple specialists working together."

**[Type your chosen task, e.g.:]**
- Marketing: `Create a complete campaign for a B2B SaaS product. Research competitors, write ad copy, design landing page structure.`
- Development: `Build a simple API endpoint with tests. Research best practices, write the code, create documentation.`
- Research: `Analyze the market for AI coding assistants. Create a competitive landscape report with recommendations.`

**[Press Enter, then narrate as agents respond:]**

> "Watch what happens. The CEO agent analyzes this task and creates a plan—it generates planning files and task lists that agents will follow and update as they work. It's now breaking down the work and delegating to specialists..."

**[Point to agent tree/delegation flow:]**

> "This isn't one AI—it's specialist agents coordinating like a real organization. Each one is optimized for its specific task."

---

### PART 2: Cross-Platform Execution (60 seconds)

**[Click: Terminal tab or show local execution]**

> "Proto is cross-platform—it runs on Mac and cloud Linux. We have Ubuntu instances with the software already installed and working."

**[Show terminal command being executed]**

> "Full terminal access—it can run any command, execute scripts, deploy code, manage infrastructure. Same capabilities on local Mac or cloud Linux."

> "Multi-computer orchestration—having multiple machines work together simultaneously—is on the roadmap. The infrastructure is ready: SSH, VNC, cloud VM provisioning. What we're building next is the coordination layer."

**[If time, show cloud VM or mention it]**

> "Once that's built, this could be hundreds of machines working in parallel on different parts of the same project."

---

### PART 3: Output Generation (60 seconds)

**[Click: Files tab]**

> "Let's look at what it's produced."

**[Open generated files]**

> "Notice the quality—this isn't generic output. Each specialist agent produced work in their domain of expertise."

**[Open another file showing coordination]**

> "And see how the work connects together. The agents aren't working in isolation—they're coordinating, passing context, building on each other's output."

---

### PART 4: Enterprise Controls (60 seconds)

**[Back to Chat, show the summary/report:]**

> "The CEO agent summarizes what was done. Proto can run fully autonomously, but for users who want oversight, we have optional controls."

**[Point to approval gate in chat if enabled:]**

> "See this approval gate? This is optional—users can configure Proto to pause for human sign-off on sensitive actions like spending money, publishing, or trading. But it can also run without any gates."

> "The goal is to automate any human labor. When a task genuinely requires human involvement, the AI will hire and delegate—that's on the roadmap. It's about the AI making the decision of when humans are needed—the right playbook and specialized agent for each situation."

---

### CLOSE (30 seconds)

**[Show: Full interface again]**

> "What you just saw was a complex, multi-step process executed by coordinated AI agents. The software runs on Mac and cloud Linux—cross-platform."

> "This same architecture can run any business—agency services, e-commerce, content, SaaS products, freelance operations. Even non-computer-based businesses—for physical tasks, Proto hires and manages humans while AI handles everything else. We'll explore different business types and double down on what works."

> "Proto can run fully autonomously. The approval gates are optional—enterprise controls for users who want oversight on sensitive actions. It's already capable of spawning thousands of products and services. When tasks need humans, Proto hires and manages them. That's the autonomous company factory."

**[Pause for questions]**

---

## Talking Points for Q&A

- **"How do you prevent mistakes?"** → Proto can run fully autonomously. For users who want oversight: optional approval gates, audit logs, kill switch
- **"Why so many agents?"** → Specialization matters—a developer writes code differently than a designer creates layouts. Just like real companies.
- **"What if the model hallucinates?"** → Verification loops, real execution (not just text), optional human review gates
- **"Why not just use ChatGPT/Claude directly?"** → Proto is built for orchestration—coordinating many agents, many computers, many tasks, self-improving. Single-model tools can't do that.
- **"What business will you run first?"** → We'll explore different types: agency services, content, e-commerce, SaaS products, freelance operations. First success proves capability—then we scale to thousands.

## Failure Recovery

| If This Fails | Do This |
|---------------|---------|
| Agent stuck | Say "Let me restart this agent" and refresh |
| Cloud VM disconnects | Switch to local demo only |
| Task takes too long | Jump to pre-saved files in `demo_fallback/` |
| Complete failure | Play pre-recorded video |

## Key Messages to Reinforce

1. **Specialist agents** coordinating like a company
2. **Project planning system** — creates planning files and task lists that agents follow and update for complex projects
3. **Cross-platform** (Mac + cloud Linux)—multi-computer orchestration on roadmap
4. **Self-improvement on roadmap** — will get better with each task
5. **Approval gates** — optional enterprise controls for sensitive actions
6. **Any business** — not limited to one domain
7. **Path to autonomy** — architecture is ready, reliability is the work
