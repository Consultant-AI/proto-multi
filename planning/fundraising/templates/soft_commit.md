## Creating Urgency (Round Filling)

### Subject: Proto update - round filling

Hi [Name],

Quick update on Proto:

We've had strong interest and are now [X]% allocated on the round. Expecting to close [date] or when we hit [amount].

You mentioned [what they said about interest/timeline]. Wanted to check in before things move forward.

Would you consider coming in at $[25K/50K]? That's [specific deliverable-e.g., "3 months of aggressive compute" or "one engineer for 2 months"].

Happy to hop on a quick call this week to finalize.

## After Milestone Hit

### Subject: Proto update - [milestone]

Hi [Name],

Update since we last spoke:

[1-2 sentences about milestone achieved - e.g., "Complex process ran end-to-end for 14 days with 40% lower intervention rate than week 1" or "First autonomous revenue generated-$X from [business type]."]

This was the proof point you mentioned needing. Round is [X]% allocated, targeting close by [date].

Would you consider $[amount]? Ready to send the SAFE this week if you're in.

## Gentle Push (For Slow Responders)

### Subject: Proto - checking in

Hi [Name],

Following up from our last conversation. I know these decisions take time.

Where are you at on Proto? Happy to:
- Answer any remaining questions
- Do another call if helpful
- Give you space if timing isn't right

Just want to know where we stand so I can plan accordingly.

## Notes:

- Don't be pushy, but be direct
- Real urgency is better than fake urgency
- If they're not responding, they're probably a no-don't chase forever
- Document soft commits immediately with expected amount
- Follow up on soft commits every 7-10 days until signed
