## After They Accept (First Message)

Hi [Name], thanks for connecting!

Quick context: I'm building Proto—a system that coordinates specialist AI agents across multiple computers to run business operations autonomously.

Whatever works fastest—agency, SaaS, content, e-commerce, trading—then scaling to a portfolio of autonomous businesses. Big opportunity—agents aren't maximized yet, and there's massive attention and resources flowing in.

90-sec demo: [link]
One-pager: [link]

Raising $300-500K pre-seed. Worth a 20-min call if AI agents/infrastructure is in your wheelhouse.

## Notes:

- LinkedIn is noisier than email—keep messages short
- Profile photo and headline matter—make sure yours look professional
- Don't spam—2 follow-ups max, then move on
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 2-4pm their timezone
- Personalize when you can (comment on their content, reference their investments)
