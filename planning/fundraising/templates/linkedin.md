## Connection Request (With Note)

**Note limit: 300 characters**

### Version A: Insight-Led

Hi [Name]—autonomous companies are inevitable. We believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from the threshold. I'm building the infrastructure to cross it first. 90-sec demo: [short link]. Raising pre-seed.

### Version B: Thesis-Led

Hi [Name]—working on autonomous company infrastructure. Saw you're interested in [AI/agents/their thesis]. Would love to connect and share what I'm building.

## After They Accept (First Message)

Hi [Name], thanks for connecting!

**The insight:** Any business that hires people can be run by AI—and when tasks absolutely require humans, the AI hires them. We believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from that threshold. The first system to cross it gets a compounding advantage.

**What I built:** Proto coordinates specialist AI agents to run business operations autonomously. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux). Self-improvement and human delegation on roadmap. We'll explore different business types—agency services, SaaS products, content, e-commerce, freelance operations.

## Notes:

- LinkedIn is noisier than email—keep messages short
- Profile photo and headline matter—make sure yours look professional
- Don't spam—2 follow-ups max, then move on
- Best times: Tuesday-Thursday, 9-11am or 2-4pm their timezone
- Personalize when you can (comment on their content, reference their investments)
