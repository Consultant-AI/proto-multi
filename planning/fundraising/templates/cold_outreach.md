## Version A: Short & Direct

### Subject: Autonomous company infrastructure - 90 sec demo

Hey [Name],

Building Proto: specialist AI agents coordinating across multiple computers to run businesses autonomously. Whatever works fastest—agency work, SaaS, content, e-commerce, trading. The autonomous company factory.

90-sec demo: [link]

Raising $300-500K pre-seed. Worth 20 min if you're looking at AI agents/infrastructure.

## Version B: Slightly Longer

### Subject: AI agents running companies - pre-seed

Hi [Name],

Saw you invested in [Company] and thought Proto might be interesting.

I'm building autonomous company infrastructure—a system that coordinates specialist AI agents across multiple computers to run complex business operations without constant supervision.

The architecture is built: multi-agent orchestration, multi-computer control, approval gates for safety, self-improvement systems. Big opportunity—autonomous companies are 12-24 months away, agents aren't maximized yet, and there's massive attention and resources flowing into the space.

Raising $300-500K to hire 2 engineers and cross the reliability threshold.

Happy to do a 20-min call if this is in your wheelhouse.

## Version C: Thesis-Led

### Subject: Autonomous companies are inevitable

Hi [Name],

Premise: Software will eventually run entire businesses, not just tasks. The question is timing.

I believe we're 12-24 months from a capability threshold where AI agents can reliably execute complex business processes autonomously. Proto is built to cross that threshold first.

Today: specialist agents, multi-computer orchestration, approval gates for human oversight. Running supervised—decreasing intervention over time.

What changes at the threshold: instead of selling software, we run companies. Whatever works fastest—agency work, SaaS, content, e-commerce, trading. Then a portfolio. The autonomous company factory.

Would love 20 minutes to talk through the thesis if it resonates.

## Notes:

- Personalize the opening when possible (reference their portfolio, thesis, tweets)
- Keep it short—busy people skim
- Demo link is required—don't send without it
- Don't follow up more than twice (2-3 days, then 7 days)
- Track opens/clicks if possible
