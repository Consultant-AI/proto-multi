## Version A: Insight-Led & Direct

### Subject: Autonomous companies are inevitable - 90 sec demo

Hey [Name],

Any business that hires people can be run by AI—and when tasks absolutely require humans, the AI hires them. We believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from that threshold. The first system to cross it gets a compounding advantage.

I'm building that system. Proto coordinates specialist AI agents to run businesses autonomously. We'll explore different business types—agency services, SaaS products, content, e-commerce, freelance operations.

Raising $500K pre-seed. Would you consider a 20-min call?

## Version B: Slightly Longer

### Subject: AI agents running companies - pre-seed

Hi [Name],

Saw you invested in [Company] and thought Proto might be interesting.

I'm building autonomous company infrastructure—a system that coordinates specialist AI agents to run complex business operations without constant supervision. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), with multi-computer orchestration on the roadmap.

The architecture is built: project planning system (agents follow and update task lists for complex projects), programming, GUI control, integrations, playbooks. Self-improvement systems on roadmap. Big opportunity—agentic systems getting better every day, we believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from the reliability threshold. First to cross gets compounding advantage.

Raising $500K to hire 2 engineers and cross the reliability threshold.

Happy to do a 20-min call if this is in your wheelhouse.

## Version C: Thesis-Led

### Subject: Autonomous companies are inevitable

Hi [Name],

Premise: Software will eventually run entire businesses, not just tasks. The question is timing.

I believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from a capability threshold where AI agents can reliably execute complex business processes—hiring humans when tasks genuinely need them. Proto is built to cross that threshold first. The first system to cross gets compounding advantage.

Today: specialist agents, cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), can run fully autonomously (optional approval gates for enterprise control). Multi-computer orchestration on roadmap.

What changes at the threshold: instead of selling software, we spawn companies. We'll explore different business types—agency services, SaaS products, content, e-commerce, freelance operations, even copying successful models. Not just computer-based businesses—for physical tasks, Proto hires humans while AI handles everything else. Then thousands of products and services. The autonomous company factory.

Would love 20 minutes to talk through the thesis if it resonates.

## Notes:

- Personalize the opening when possible (reference their portfolio, thesis, tweets)
- Keep it short—busy people skim
- Demo link is required—don't send without it
- Don't follow up more than twice (2-3 days, then 7 days)
- Track opens/clicks if possible
