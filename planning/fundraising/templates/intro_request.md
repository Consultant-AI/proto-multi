# Intro Request Email Template

**Use when:** Asking founders/operators/friends for intros to investors

---

## The "Forwardable Email" Format

The key insight: your connector will forward your email. Make it easy for them. Structure it so they can forward it directly with minimal editing.

**The 3-Part Structure:**
1. **Context** - Why you're reaching out, what you're building
2. **Credibility** - Why you/the company are worth meeting
3. **Ask** - Specific, clear request

## Subject: Quick ask - intro to [Investor Name]?

## Body:

Hey [Name],

Quick ask: could you intro me to [Investor Name] at [Fund]?

I'm raising for Proto-a group of AI agents that create and run products and services autonomously. The goal is a portfolio of AI-run businesses.

Built the whole stack solo (backend, frontend, agent orchestration, multi-computer control). Now raising $500K to hire 2 engineers and prove the model works.

[One-pager link]

If you think [Investor Name] would find this interesting, happy to send you a blurb to forward. No pressure either way-I know intros are a real ask.

Thanks,
Nir
nir@proto.works

## Forwardable Blurb (for your contact to use):

**Option 1: Short version**

"Hey [Investor], wanted to connect you with Nir Feinstein. He's building Proto-AI agents that create and run products and services autonomously. The goal is a portfolio of AI-run businesses.

Built the whole thing solo, now raising pre-seed. Demo is wild: [90-sec video link]

Worth a 20-min call if you're looking at AI agents."

---

**Option 2: Structured version (Context → Credibility → Ask)**

"Hey [Investor],

Wanted to introduce you to Nir Feinstein-he's raising a pre-seed for Proto.

**What it is:** AI agents that create and run products and services autonomously. Not a copilot-a system that runs entire businesses. The goal is a portfolio of AI-run companies.

**Why he's credible:** Built the entire stack solo-backend, frontend, agent orchestration, cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux). Working prototype, not a deck. First-principles approach: designed it from the ground up for autonomous operation.

**The ask:** $500K pre-seed, $5M cap. Looking for angels who see the opportunity in autonomous companies.

Demo: [90-sec video link]
One-pager: [link]

Worth a 20-min call if you're looking at AI infrastructure."

## Double Opt-In Best Practice

Never assume someone will make an intro. Always use "double opt-in":

1. Ask your connector: "Would you be comfortable introducing me to [Investor]?"
2. Let them check with the investor first
3. If both say yes, they make the intro

**Why this matters:**
- Respects everyone's time and relationships
- Higher conversion rate on warm intros
- Doesn't burn your connector's relationship capital

---

## Follow-Up Sequence

**If no response from connector:**
- Day 3-4: Light nudge ("Just floating this back up-no rush if timing isn't right")
- Day 7-10: Final follow-up ("Totally understand if this isn't a fit-appreciate you considering it")

**If intro is made:**
- Reply-all within 24 hours thanking connector
- Move connector to BCC after first reply
- Follow up with connector after the meeting (they'll want to know how it went)

---

## Notes:

- Always include the 90-sec demo-it's your best asset
- Make the forwardable blurb easy to copy-paste
- Don't oversell-let them decide if it's a fit
- Be specific about what you're raising ($500K, $5M cap)
- Acknowledge that intros are "real asks"-shows awareness
- Follow up in 3-4 days if no response
- After the meeting, circle back to thank the connector

---

## What NOT to Do

- Don't send a 5-paragraph pitch and ask them to summarize it
- Don't be vague ("raising some money for my startup")
- Don't skip the demo link-it's your strongest asset
- Don't pressure ("I really need this intro")
- Don't forget to follow up and thank them
