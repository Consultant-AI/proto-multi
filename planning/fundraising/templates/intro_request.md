## Subject: Quick ask - intro to [Investor Name]?

## Body:

Hey [Name],

Quick ask: could you intro me to [Investor Name] at [Fund]?

I'm raising for Proto-a group of AI agents that create and run products and services autonomously. The goal is a portfolio of AI-run businesses.

Built the whole stack solo (backend, frontend, agent orchestration, multi-computer control). Now raising $500K to hire 2 engineers and prove the model works.

[One-pager link]

If you think [Investor Name] would find this interesting, happy to send you a blurb to forward. No pressure either way-I know intros are a real ask.

Thanks,
[Your name]

## Forwardable Blurb (for your contact to use):

"Hey [Investor], wanted to connect you with [Your name]. He's building Proto-a group of AI agents that create and run products and services autonomously. The goal is a portfolio of AI-run businesses.

Built the whole thing solo, now raising pre-seed. Demo is wild: [90-sec video link]

Worth a 20-min call if you're looking at AI agents."

## Notes:

- Always include the 90-sec demo-it's your best asset
- Make the forwardable blurb easy to copy-paste
- Don't oversell-let them decide if it's a fit
- Follow up in 3-4 days if no response
