## Subject: Quick ask - intro to [Investor Name]?

## Body:

Hey [Name],

Quick ask: could you intro me to [Investor Name] at [Fund]?

I'm raising for Proto—building autonomous company infrastructure. The short version: I've built a system that coordinates specialist AI agents across multiple computers to run complex business operations. Whatever works fastest—agency work, SaaS, content, e-commerce, trading—then scale to a portfolio of autonomous businesses.

Built the whole stack solo (backend, frontend, agent orchestration, multi-computer control). Now raising $300-500K to hire 2 engineers and prove the model works.

If you think [Investor Name] would find this interesting, happy to send you a blurb to forward. No pressure either way—I know intros are a real ask.

Thanks,
[Your name]
