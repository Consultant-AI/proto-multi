## SLIDE 1: Title

**Visual:** Proto logo, tagline

**Content:**
- Proto
- The Autonomous Company Factory
- Nir Feinstein | Pre-Seed | [Date]

**Talking points:**
- "Proto is infrastructure for autonomous companies—businesses run entirely by AI agents."
- "This is a massive opportunity. Let me show you why."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Opportunity

**Visual:** Simple text: "Autonomous companies are inevitable"

**Content:**
- Software automated tasks → workflows → departments → **companies**
- The question: WHEN and WHO builds it first
- We think: 12-24 months to the threshold

**Talking points:**
- "AI will run entire businesses—not just tasks, entire companies."
- "The capabilities exist. What's missing is reliability."
- "Four things have converged: model capability, computer use, tooling maturity, and massive attention and resources—billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month."
- "Whoever crosses the reliability threshold first captures the market."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Prize

**Visual:** Compounding diagram: Business → Revenue → More businesses → More revenue

**Content:**
- First autonomous company system = compounding money machine
- Each business generates revenue AND improves the system
- Portfolio of autonomous companies

**Talking points:**
- "Once you can reliably run one business, you can run ten. Or a hundred."
- "Each business generates data that makes Proto better."
- "The prize isn't one company—it's the ability to create unlimited companies."

---

## SLIDE 4: What Proto Is (Built Today)

**Visual:** Architecture diagram—agents, computers, self-improvement loop

**Content:**
- **Specialist agents** organized like a company (C-Suite → Directors → Specialists)
- **Multi-computer control**: local machines + remote servers (SSH/VNC) + cloud VMs (Hetzner)
- **Real computer use**: files, terminal, GUI automation, browser control
- **Self-improvement**: auto-captures learnings, retrieves knowledge, improves approaches
- **Enterprise controls**: approval gates, audit logs, kill switch

**Talking points:**
- "This isn't a concept—it's built. Specialist agents organized like a company."
- "Any agent can call any other specialist when it needs expertise—peer-to-peer collaboration."
- "It controls real computers: local, remote servers, cloud VMs—all through one interface."
- "Real tools: file operations, terminal commands, GUI automation—screenshots, mouse, keyboard."
- "Self-improvement is built in: every task teaches the system something. It captures learnings and applies them to future work."
- "Enterprise controls: approval gates for sensitive actions, full audit logs, kill switch."

---

## SLIDE 5: Demo

**Visual:** [Live demo or video embed]

**Content:**
- 90-sec highlight or live demo
- Show: complex task → multi-agent coordination → execution → output

**Talking points:**
- "Let me show you what this looks like."
- [Run demo per demo_script.md]
- "You just saw Proto execute a complex, multi-step process across multiple computers."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Hybrid Model

**Visual:** Diagram showing different AI-human configurations (fully automated → AI manages humans → humans review AI)

**Content:**
**The end goal: automate any human labor.**

When full automation isn't possible, Proto uses hybrid models:

| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| AI does everything | Fully automated, end-to-end |
| AI hires people | Proto recruits and manages human workers |
| AI delegates to humans | Break down work, assign to people, synthesize |
| Humans as reviewers | AI executes, humans approve |
| Humans for key decisions | AI prepares options, humans decide |

**Key:** It's not a ladder—it's different models for different needs.

**Talking points:**
- "The end goal is to automate any human labor."
- "But when full automation isn't possible yet, Proto can use hybrid models."
- "Proto can hire people, delegate tasks to humans, use humans as reviewers, or bring them in for key decisions."
- "A trading operation might be fully automated. A creative agency might have AI managing human designers."
- "It's not a progression—it's whatever model fits the task. Maximum value, minimum human labor."

---

## SLIDE 7: The Business Model

**Visual:** Grid showing business types with examples

**Content:**
- Proto is not SaaS. We don't sell software.
- We run businesses—whatever works fastest
- First business = proof of concept → Goal = portfolio

| Business Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| AI/SaaS Products | Build and launch software products |
| Content & Media | AI-generated content at scale |
| Agency Services | Marketing, development, automation services |
| Domain-Specific Agents | Sell specialized AI agents for industries |
| Freelance Operations | Execute work on Upwork, Fiverr, etc. |
| E-commerce | Dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| Trading & Arbitrage | Algorithmic trading, market inefficiencies |
| Service Businesses | Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed) |

**Key insight:** Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed). Not just service businesses—any computer-based business that relies on human labor can be run by Proto.

**Talking points:**
- "The key insight: any business that would hire people, Proto hires AI instead. Not just services—any computer-based business."
- "We're not selling Proto. We're using it to run businesses."
- "Could be building a SaaS product, running a marketing agency, generating content at scale, trading, e-commerce—whatever works fastest."
- "We can also sell specialized agents as products—a trading agent, a content agent, a customer support agent."
- "The scope expands as AI improves. The first business proves the capability. Then we scale to many."

## SLIDE 8: The Market Gap

**Visual:** Two columns: Current Agents | What's Missing

**Content:**
**Current AI Agents:**
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Claude Code) — only write code
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x) — only handle sales
- Support agents (Zendesk AI) — only answer tickets
- Open source (AutoGPT, CrewAI) — frameworks, not businesses

**What's Missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination (coding + marketing + sales + operations)
- Self-improvement (agents don't learn from failures and get better)
- Full autonomy goal (everyone builds copilots, not autonomous operations)

**The opportunity:** Agents aren't maximized yet. Self-improvement is the key—each task makes Proto better.

**Talking points:**
- "Look at current AI agents—they're all domain-specific silos. Devin writes code. Lindy does sales. Zendesk answers tickets."
- "No one combines everything. Almost no one self-improves."
- "Agents aren't maximized yet—there's so much untapped potential."
- "Self-improvement is the unlock. Each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's compounding."

## SLIDE 9: Team + Why Now

**Visual:** Founder photo + three converging arrows

**Content:**
- Built entire stack solo: agents, multi-computer, self-improvement
- First-principles approach: started with end goal, broke down into components
- Window: Models work, computer use works, massive resources flowing in, gap in market
- First mover with self-improvement has compounding advantage

**Team Philosophy (for post-raise):**
- One strong "Alpha" leader who can scale with the company
- Technical founder + need high-quality engineers (CTO-level)
- Complementary personalities: visionary + executor balance

**Talking points:**
- "I built all of this solo—backend, frontend, agent orchestration, self-improvement systems."
- "Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently."
- "First-principles approach: I started with the end goal—AI that self-improves and runs companies. Then I broke it down into components and built each one. Not a wrapper on existing tools—purpose-built from the ground up."
- "Four things converged: model capability, computer use, massive attention and resources, gap in market."
- "The first system with real self-improvement compounds—every business makes it better. That's the moat."
- "Post-raise, I'll bring on senior engineers who complement my strengths—people who can execute while I focus on vision and architecture."

## SLIDE 10: The Ask

**Visual:** Clean layout with numbers + breakdown

**Content:**
- **Raising:** $300-500K (Close A) → $1-2M (Close B)
- **Use:** Founder + 2 engineers + aggressive compute for 12 months
- **Milestones:** Self-improvement working → domain mastery → complete product/service delivered autonomously

**Fund Allocation (tie dollars to deliverables):**
| Item | Monthly | 12 Months | What It Enables |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Founder | ₪35K (~$10K) | ~$120K | Full-time leadership + development |
| 2 Engineers | ₪70K (~$20K) | ~$240K | Senior team to build reliability |
| Compute | ~$4K | ~$48K | Aggressive API + cloud for continuous testing |
| Overhead | ₪12K (~$3K) | ~$36K | Operations, legal, tools |
| **Total** | ~$37K | **~$450K** | 12 months to hit milestones |

**Talking points:**
- "Raising $300-500K to prove the model works."
- "Here's exactly where it goes: me full-time, two senior engineers, aggressive compute budget."
- "$50K gets us one engineer for 3 months. $25K gets aggressive compute for 6 months. Every dollar maps to capability."
- "Milestones: self-improvement demonstrably working, mastery of at least one domain, complete product or service delivered autonomously."
- "Looking for investors who see the opportunity in autonomous companies and want to be part of building it."

**Philosophy: Money as Food, Not Oxygen**
- Don't stockpile cash like oxygen—you can "die from too much of it" (Brian Chesky)
- Too much money kills innovation and focus
- We're raising what we need to hit milestones, not padding a war chest
- Revenue from customers is the true oxygen—VC is just fuel to get there faster

| Open Source | AutoGPT, SuperAGI, CrewAI, LangGraph, Agent-S | Build custom agents | Frameworks, not businesses—require development |
| Computer Use | Adept, Anthropic Computer Use | Control GUIs | Single-task focused, no multi-agent orchestration |
| Labs | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | Build foundation models | Building models, not operating businesses |

**Why not OpenAI/Anthropic?**
- They could build this—but they haven't
- Their business: sell API to millions of developers, not run businesses
- First-mover with self-improvement has edge
- Different game: they want to be the platform, we want to own the gold mines

## Design Notes

**#0 Rule: You Might Not Even Need a Deck**
- The Retool founder raised his seed round without a deck—just opened his laptop and demoed
- If you have a working product, that IS your pitch
- A rough working prototype beats a polished deck asking for money to build
- Many angels prefer just talking to the founder over watching slides

**#1 Rule: Don't Be Boring**
- Capture attention in the first 30 seconds
- If you're bored making the deck, investors will be bored watching it
- Energy and conviction matter as much as content

**Demo > Deck**
- Your product demo is your best collateral
- A rough working prototype > polished slides about a future product
- If you can show it working, show it—don't just talk about it

**Don't Try to "Impress"**
- No "magic words" or fancy jargon
- Investors get bored by founders trying to "sell" them
- Use plain language—same way you'd talk to a friend
- The best pitches don't feel like pitches

**Rocket Ship, Not The Math**
- Think NASA: "We're going to the moon!" (vision, impact) beats fuel ratios and engine specs (technical details)
- Investors are busy—if you get into the weeds, their eyes glaze over
- Focus on: What's the need? How do you address it? Why are you better? How can they help?
- Save technical deep-dives for the appendix or follow-up questions

**Do:**
- Dark background, high contrast
- One message per slide
- Large font (min 24pt)
- Real screenshots from Proto
- Minimal bullet points
- Clear, confident language

**Don't:**
- Wall of text
- Multiple messages per slide
- Clip art or stock photos
- Complicated diagrams
- Animation (distracting in calls)
- Overselling or being vague

**Tools:**
- Figma for design
- Export to PDF (not PPTX)
- Test screen share before calls

## Delivery Tips

**Be Ready to Ditch the Deck**
- Practice pitching without slides (3+ times minimum)
- If tech fails or investor prefers conversation, deliver the story verbally
- The deck supports your story—it's not a crutch
- Many angel investors prefer just listening to the founder talk

**During the Pitch:**
- Total time: 15-20 minutes with demo
- Demo in the middle (slide 5) to break up talking
- Leave 10+ minutes for Q&A
- Be confident about the opportunity
- Close with: "Looking for investors who see the opportunity in autonomous companies. Questions?"
