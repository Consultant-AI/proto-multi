# Proto Pitch Deck Outline

**Format:** 10 slides, 15-20 minutes with demo
**Design notes:** Dark theme, minimal text, one key message per slide
**Tone:** Big opportunity. Clear about the vision and path to get there.

**Stage-Specific Focus:**
| Stage | Primary Focus | What You Must Prove |
|-------|---------------|---------------------|
| Pre-Seed | **Team** | Team's capacity to build the product |
| Seed | **Customer Traction** | Initial growth tactics are replicable |
| Series A | **Growth Metrics** | Deep understanding of growth numbers |
| Series B | **Market Domination** | Metrics proving you can take over the market |

**Proto is Pre-Seed → Focus on team capability + working prototype**

**Pre-Seed Validation Expectations:**
- Qualitative validation (founder-market fit, working prototype, clear articulation)
- Evidence of technical competence (built it solo)
- NOT expected: revenue, large user base, PMF metrics
- Key question you must answer: "Can this founder build it?" → Demo answers YES

**What Investors Look For in Pre-Seed Founders:**
1. **Founder-Market Fit** - Why THIS founder for THIS problem?
2. **Technical Autonomy** - Can build without external dependencies
3. **Proof of Hustle** - Evidence of "escape velocity" and making things happen
4. **Coachability** - Can absorb feedback and iterate
5. **Capital Efficiency** - Can do a lot with a little

## Strategic Framework

*For detailed slide-by-slide psychology and one-pager alignment guidance, see [Pitch Deck Architecture](../FUNDRAISING_GUIDE.md#pitch-deck-architecture) in the Fundraising Guide.*

**Key principle:** At pre-seed, investors fund **insight** rather than traction. The deck must articulate a clear "secret" about the market that others have overlooked.

**Proto's "Why Now?" (critical slide):**
- All components exist (model capability, computer use, orchestration, tooling)
- AI capabilities improving every month - infrastructure that scales with improvement
- 40% of enterprise apps have task agents - but all domain silos
- First system with cross-domain + self-improvement compounds
- The reliability problem WILL be solved - massive resources flowing in

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

**Visual:** Proto logo, tagline

**Content:**
- Proto
- The Autonomous Company Factory
- Nir Feinstein | Pre-Seed | [Date]

**Talking points:**
- "Proto is infrastructure for autonomous companies-businesses run entirely by AI agents."
- "This is a massive opportunity. Let me show you why."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Opportunity

**Visual:** Simple text: "Autonomous companies are inevitable"

**Content:**
- Software automated tasks → workflows → departments → **companies**
- Software market: ~$600B | Labor market: ~$90 TRILLION
- We're not competing with software-we're replacing labor
- The question: WHEN and WHO builds it first
- We believe there's a high chance: 12-24 months to the threshold

**Talking points:**
- "AI will run entire businesses-not just tasks, entire companies."
- "Software is eating labor. The labor market is 100x bigger than the software market."
- "Proto isn't competing with software companies-we're replacing labor. Any business that would hire people, Proto hires AI instead."
- "When AI does a $47K job for $20K/year, that's not a software sale-that's labor replacement."
- "Everybody wants two things: to be richer and to save time, resources and energy. That's what Proto delivers."
- "All the components exist-model capability, computer use, orchestration, tooling. The pieces just need to be connected into a reliable system."
- "AI capabilities will only keep improving. We're not betting on current limitations-we're building infrastructure for capabilities that get better every month."
- "Four things have converged: model capability, computer use, tooling maturity, and massive attention and resources-billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month."
- "Agentic systems are getting better every day-this will continue throughout 2026 and beyond. The reliability gap is closing fast."
- "The first system to cross that threshold gets a compounding advantage-playbooks, data, and running revenue while others are still building."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Prize

**Visual:** Compounding diagram: Business → Revenue → More businesses → More revenue

**Content:**
- First autonomous company system = compounding money machine
- Capable of spawning thousands of products and services simultaneously
- Each business generates revenue AND improves the system
- Portfolio of autonomous companies

**Talking points:**
- "Once you can reliably run one business, you can run ten. Or a hundred. Or thousands."
- "Each business generates data that makes Proto better."
- "The prize isn't one company-it's the ability to create unlimited companies."

---

## SLIDE 4: What Proto Is

**Visual:** Architecture diagram-agents, computers, roadmap items

**Content:**
**Built Today:**
- **Specialist agents** organized like a company (C-Suite → Directors → Specialists)
- **Project planning system**: creates planning files and task lists for each project-agents follow and update them to handle complex projects systematically
- **Cross-platform & cloud-ready**: runs on Mac + cloud Linux (Ubuntu); cloud VMs (Hetzner) provisioned
- **Real computer use**: files, terminal, GUI automation (screenshots, mouse, keyboard-giving agents access to any tool a human can use), browser control
- **Enterprise controls (optional)**: Proto can run fully autonomously; optional approval gates, audit logs, kill switch

**On Roadmap:**
- Multi-computer orchestration (multiple machines working together)
- Self-improvement systems (evaluation per task, automatic code/playbook updates)
- Hybrid human delegation (AI hiring and managing humans when needed)

**Talking points:**
- "This isn't a concept-it's built. Specialist agents organized like a company."
- "Any agent can call any other specialist when it needs expertise-peer-to-peer collaboration."
- "For each project, Proto creates planning files and task lists. Agents follow them and update them as they work. This is how it handles big, complex projects-breaking them down systematically."
- "It controls real computers-runs on Mac and cloud Linux. Ubuntu instances already set up with the software."
- "Real tools: file operations, terminal commands, GUI automation-screenshots, mouse, keyboard-giving agents access to any tool a human can use on a computer."
- "Enterprise controls are optional-Proto can run fully autonomously. Users who want oversight can enable approval gates, audit logs, kill switch."
- "On the roadmap: multi-computer orchestration, self-improvement systems, and hybrid human delegation. These are what we're building with the funding."

---

## SLIDE 5: Demo

**Visual:** [Live demo or video embed]

**Content:**
- 90-sec highlight or live demo
- Show: complex task → multi-agent coordination → execution → output

**Talking points:**
- "Let me show you what this looks like."
- [Run demo per demo_script.md]
- "You just saw Proto execute a complex, multi-step process with coordinated specialist agents."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Hybrid Model (On Roadmap)

**Visual:** Diagram showing different AI-human configurations (fully automated → AI manages humans → humans review AI)

**Content:**
**The end goal: automate any human labor.**

When full automation isn't possible, Proto will use hybrid models:

| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| AI does everything | Fully automated, end-to-end |
| AI hires people | Proto recruits and manages human workers |
| AI delegates to humans | Break down work, assign to people, synthesize |
| Humans as reviewers | AI executes, humans approve |
| Humans for key decisions | AI prepares options, humans decide |

**Key:** The unlock is the right playbook and a specialized, reliable agent or process. This is what we're building.

**Talking points:**
- "The end goal is to automate any human labor."
- "When full automation isn't possible, Proto will use hybrid models-this is on the roadmap."
- "The vision: Proto can hire people, delegate tasks to humans, use humans as reviewers, or bring them in for key decisions."
- "The unlock is having the right playbook and a specialized, reliable agent for each situation."
- "Today we have the core agent orchestration. Self-improvement and human delegation are what we're building next."

---

## SLIDE 7: The Business Model

**Visual:** Grid showing business types with examples

**Content:**
- Proto is not SaaS. We don't sell software.
- We run businesses-exploring different business types
- First business = proof of concept → Goal = portfolio

| Business Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| AI/SaaS Products | Build and launch software products |
| Content & Media | AI-generated content at scale |
| Agency Services | AI agents as the service, or AI + human-in-the-loop agencies |
| Domain-Specific Agents | Sell specialized AI agents for industries |
| Freelance Operations | Execute work on Upwork, Fiverr, etc. |
| E-commerce | Dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| Copying Successful Models | Replicate proven businesses-unlimited labor means unlimited experiments |
| Human-in-Loop Platforms | Coordinate humans for tasks AI can't do yet |
| Physical/Non-Digital Businesses | For tasks requiring physical presence, Proto hires and manages humans |
| Any Business | Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI (and humans when absolutely needed) |

**Key insight:** Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. Even non-computer-based businesses can be automated by hiring humans for physical tasks while AI handles everything else.

**Talking points:**
- "The key insight: any business that would hire people, Proto hires AI instead. Even non-computer-based businesses can be automated-for physical tasks, Proto hires and manages humans while AI handles everything else."
- "We're not selling Proto. We're using it to run businesses."
- "Value creation, not just cost savings: Salient (AI collections) grew 0 to $30M by pitching 'we collect 50% MORE revenue,' not 'we're cheaper than humans.' That's the model."
- "AI expands markets-opens work that was never economically viable. Eve can now take $5K cases that would never justify attorney time."
- "We'll explore different business types: SaaS products, marketing agencies, content at scale, e-commerce, freelance operations."
- "We can also sell specialized agents as products-a content agent, a customer support agent, a development agent."
- "The scope expands as AI improves. The first business proves the capability. Then we scale to many."

## SLIDE 8: The Market Gap

**Visual:** Two columns: Current Agents | What's Missing

**Content:**
**The "AI Agent Boom" is Here (January 2026):**
We've transitioned from generative models to autonomous Agentic AI. 40% of enterprise apps now feature task agents. But EVERY player is a domain-specific silo:

- **Enterprise**: Agentforce ($540M ARR), Microsoft Copilot Studio, Google Vertex AI - platform-locked
- **Coding**: Devin AI, Copilot (20M users), Cursor ($500M ARR), Claude Code ($500M ARR in 3 months) - only code
- **Sales/Marketing**: Robylon, Apollo.io (300M+ contacts), Clay - only outreach
- **HR**: Metaview, Sloneek, IBM AskHR - only recruiting
- **Security**: Torq Socrates (90% Tier-1 automation), Check Point - only SOC ops
- **Healthcare**: Nuance DAX, Abridge (saves 1-2 hrs/day) - only documentation
- **Legal**: Harvey (unicorn), CoCounsel, Spellbook - only legal
- **Finance**: Virtuals Protocol, Fetch.ai - agents now control capital directly
- **Physical AI**: Humanoid robots from Hyundai/LG - "ChatGPT moment for physical AI"
- **Open source**: LangChain (122k stars), n8n (160k stars) - frameworks, not businesses

**What's Missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination (coding + marketing + sales + HR + security + operations)
- Self-improvement (agents don't learn from failures and get better)
- Full autonomy goal (everyone builds domain copilots, not autonomous business operations)

**The opportunity:** The industry moved beyond "flashy demos" into production-but every player owns ONE vertical. No one runs businesses.

**Talking points:**
- "We're in the AI agent boom. 40% of enterprise apps have task agents. But they're ALL domain silos."
- "Devin writes code. Agentforce does sales. Harvey does legal. Torq Socrates handles security. Nuance does medical notes. They don't talk to each other."
- "The Claude SDK ecosystem-MCP has 97 million monthly downloads-it's infrastructure for building agents, not running businesses."
- "Even Physical AI is arriving-Nvidia calls it the 'ChatGPT moment for robotics.' But it's still single-domain."
- "Agents now control capital directly-Coinbase Payments MCP enables agentic commerce. But still domain-specific."
- "No one combines everything. Almost no one self-improves."
- "Andrew Ng's research: GPT-3.5 with agentic workflows outperforms GPT-4 zero-shot. The orchestration layer is where value lives."
- "Better models make Proto MORE powerful. We're not fixing model bugs-we're building the orchestration layer. That's the moat."
- "Self-improvement is the unlock. Each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's compounding."

## SLIDE 9: Team + Why Now

**Visual:** Founder photo + three converging arrows

**Content:**
- Built entire stack solo: agents, cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), real computer use
- First-principles approach: started with end goal, broke down into components
- Window: Models work, computer use works, massive resources flowing in, gap in market
- Self-improvement on roadmap-first mover with that has compounding advantage

**Team Philosophy (for post-raise):**
- One strong "Alpha" leader who can scale with the company
- Technical founder + need high-quality engineers (CTO-level)
- Complementary personalities: visionary + executor balance

**Talking points:**
- "I built all of this solo-backend, frontend, agent orchestration, cross-platform infrastructure."
- "Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently."
- "First-principles approach: I started with the end goal-AI that self-improves and runs companies. Then I broke it down into components and built each one. Not a wrapper on existing tools-purpose-built from the ground up."
- "Four things converged: model capability, computer use, massive attention and resources, gap in market."
- "The first system with real self-improvement compounds-every business makes it better. That's the moat."
- "Post-raise, I'll bring on senior engineers who complement my strengths-people who can execute while I focus on vision and architecture."

**Demonstrate These Founder Qualities:**
- **Technical autonomy**: "Built this without waiting for co-founders or contractors"
- **Proof of hustle**: "Working prototype on minimal resources-the raise accelerates, it doesn't start"
- **Coachability**: "First-principles approach means constantly learning what works"
- **Capital efficiency**: "Built the entire platform solo-we do a lot with a little"

## SLIDE 10: The Ask

**Visual:** Clean layout with numbers + breakdown

**Content:**
- **Raising:** $500K (Close A) → $1.5M (Close B)
- **Terms:** Post-Money SAFE, $5M cap
- **Use:** Founder + 2 engineers + aggressive compute for 12 months
- **Milestones:** Self-improvement working → domain mastery (marketing, dev, or operations) → complete product/service delivered autonomously (e.g., launched SaaS, client project, revenue operation)

**Fund Allocation (tie dollars to deliverables):**
| Item | Monthly | 12 Months | What It Enables |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| Founder | $11,000 | $130,000 | Full-time leadership + development |
| 2 Engineers | $22,000 | $265,000 | Senior team to build reliability |
| Compute | $5,000 | $60,000 | Aggressive API + cloud for continuous testing |
| Overhead | $4,000 | $45,000 | Operations, legal, tools |
| Buffer | - | $75,000 | Contingency (15%) |
| **Total** | ~$42,000 | **~$575,000** | 12 months to hit milestones |

**Talking points:**
- "Raising $500K on a $5M post-money SAFE. That's 10% of the company."
- "Here's exactly where it goes: me full-time, two senior engineers, aggressive compute budget."
- "$50K gets us one engineer for 3 months. $25K gets aggressive compute for 6 months. Every dollar maps to capability."
- "Milestones: self-improvement demonstrably working, mastery of at least one domain, complete product or service delivered autonomously."
- "Looking for investors who see the opportunity in autonomous companies and want to be part of building it."

**Philosophy: Money as Food, Not Oxygen**
- Don't stockpile cash like oxygen-you can "die from too much of it" (Brian Chesky)
- Too much money kills innovation and focus
- We're raising what we need to hit milestones, not padding a war chest
- Revenue from customers is the true oxygen-VC is just fuel to get there faster

| **Agent Infrastructure** | MCP (97M+ monthly downloads), Agent Skills (20k+ stars) | Linux Foundation stewardship; OpenAI/Google adopted | Infrastructure, not operations |
| **Labs/Models** | GPT-5.2 (100% AIME), Claude Opus 4.5 (#1 agentic), Gemini 3 Pro (#1 preference), DeepSeek V3.2 (94% cheaper) | Frontier performance | Models, not businesses |

**Key insight:** Every player is a domain-specific silo. The industry moved beyond "flashy demos" into production-but all specialized tools, not systems that run businesses.

**Why not OpenAI/Anthropic/Google?**
- They could build this-but they haven't
- Their business: sell API to millions of developers, not run businesses
- The Claude SDK ecosystem (MCP, Agent Skills) shows they're building infrastructure for others
- First-mover with self-improvement has edge
- Different game: they want to be the platform, we want to own the gold mines

## Design Notes

**#0 Rule: You Might Not Even Need a Deck**
- The Retool founder raised his seed round without a deck-just opened his laptop and demoed
- If you have a working product, that IS your pitch
- A rough working prototype beats a polished deck asking for money to build
- Many angels prefer just talking to the founder over watching slides

**#1 Rule: Don't Be Boring**
- Capture attention in the first 30 seconds
- If you're bored making the deck, investors will be bored watching it
- Energy and conviction matter as much as content

**Demo > Deck**
- Your product demo is your best collateral
- A rough working prototype > polished slides about a future product
- If you can show it working, show it-don't just talk about it

**Don't Try to "Impress"**
- No "magic words" or fancy jargon
- Investors get bored by founders trying to "sell" them
- Use plain language-same way you'd talk to a friend
- The best pitches don't feel like pitches

**Rocket Ship, Not The Math**
- Think NASA: "We're going to the moon!" (vision, impact) beats fuel ratios and engine specs (technical details)
- Investors are busy-if you get into the weeds, their eyes glaze over
- Focus on: What's the need? How do you address it? Why are you better? How can they help?
- Save technical deep-dives for the appendix or follow-up questions

**Do:**
- Dark background, high contrast
- One message per slide
- Large font (min 24pt)
- Real screenshots from Proto
- Minimal bullet points
- Clear, confident language

**Don't:**
- Wall of text
- Multiple messages per slide
- Clip art or stock photos
- Complicated diagrams
- Animation (distracting in calls)
- Overselling or being vague

**Tools:**
- Figma for design
- Export to PDF (not PPTX)
- Test screen share before calls

---

## Delivery Tips

**Be Ready to Ditch the Deck**
- Practice pitching without slides (3+ times minimum)
- If tech fails or investor prefers conversation, deliver the story verbally
- The deck supports your story-it's not a crutch
- Many angel investors prefer just listening to the founder talk

**During the Pitch:**
- Total time: 15-20 minutes with demo
- Demo in the middle (slide 5) to break up talking
- Leave 10+ minutes for Q&A
- Be confident about the opportunity
- Close with: "Looking for investors who see the opportunity in autonomous companies. Questions?"
