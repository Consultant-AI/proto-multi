# Proto Pitch Deck Outline

**Format:** 10 slides, 15-20 minutes with demo
**Design:** Dark theme, minimal text, one key message per slide
**Stage:** Pre-Seed → Focus on team capability + working prototype

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

**Visual:** Proto logo, tagline

**Content:**
- Proto
- The Autonomous Company Factory
- Nir Feinstein | Pre-Seed | [Date]

**Key talking point:**
- "Proto is infrastructure for autonomous companies-businesses run entirely by AI agents."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Opportunity

**Visual:** "Autonomous companies are inevitable"

**Content:**
- Software market: ~$600B | Labor market: ~$90 TRILLION
- We're not competing with software-we're replacing labor
- 12-24 months to the capability threshold

**Key talking points:**
- "Software is eating labor. The labor market is 100x bigger."
- "Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead."
- "All the components exist. The pieces just need to be connected."

---

## SLIDE 3: The Prize

**Visual:** Compounding diagram: Business → Revenue → More businesses

**Content:**
- First autonomous company system = compounding money machine
- Each business generates revenue AND improves the system
- Endgame: portfolio of autonomous companies

**Key talking points:**
- "Once you can run one business, you can run hundreds."
- "Each business generates data that makes Proto better."

---

## SLIDE 4: What Proto Is

**Visual:** Architecture diagram

**Content:**
**Built Today:**
- Specialist agents organized like a company (C-Suite → Directors → Specialists)
- Project planning system for complex projects
- Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux)
- Real computer use (files, terminal, GUI, browser)
- Optional enterprise controls

**On Roadmap:**
- Multi-computer orchestration
- Self-improvement systems
- Hybrid human delegation

**Key talking points:**
- "This isn't a concept-it's built. Show you in a moment."
- "For each project, Proto creates planning files. Agents follow and update them."
- "Real tools: files, terminal, GUI automation-any tool a human can use."

---

## SLIDE 5: Demo

**Visual:** Live demo or 90-sec video

**Content:**
- Show: complex task → multi-agent coordination → execution → output

**Key talking points:**
- "Let me show you what this looks like."
- [Run demo]
- "Proto executing a complex process with coordinated specialist agents."

---

## SLIDE 6: The Business Model

**Visual:** Grid of business types

**Content:**
- Proto is not SaaS. **We run businesses.**
- First business = proof of concept → Goal = portfolio
- Business types: SaaS, agencies, content, e-commerce, freelance, physical (AI hires humans)

**Key talking points:**
- "Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead."
- "Value creation, not cost savings. Salient grew 0 to $30M pitching 'we collect 50% MORE.'"
- "First business proves capability. Then we scale to many."

---

## SLIDE 7: The Hybrid Model (On Roadmap)

**Visual:** AI-human configuration spectrum

**Content:**
| Model | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| AI does everything | Fully automated |
| AI hires people | Proto recruits/manages humans |
| AI delegates | Break down work, assign, synthesize |
| Humans review | AI executes, humans approve |

**Key talking points:**
- "The end goal is to automate any human labor."
- "When full automation isn't possible, Proto uses hybrid models."
- "The unlock is the right playbook and specialized agent for each situation."

---

## SLIDE 8: The Market Gap

**Visual:** Two columns: Current Agents | What's Missing

**Content:**
**40% of enterprise apps have agents - all domain silos:**
- Coding (Cursor, Claude Code) - only code
- Sales (Apollo, Clay) - only outreach
- Legal (Harvey) - only legal
- Security (Torq) - only SOC

**What's Missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination
- Self-improvement
- Full autonomy goal

**Key talking points:**
- "We're in the AI agent boom. But they're ALL domain silos."
- "Devin writes code. Harvey does legal. They don't talk to each other."
- "Self-improvement is the unlock. Each task makes Proto better at all tasks."

---

## SLIDE 9: Team + Why Now

**Visual:** Founder photo + converging arrows

**Content:**
- Built entire stack solo: agents, cross-platform, real computer use
- First-principles: started with end goal, broke down into components
- Window: Models work, computer use works, massive resources, gap in market

**Key talking points:**
- "I built all of this solo-backend, frontend, agent orchestration, infrastructure."
- "First-principles approach: started with the end goal, broke it down, built each piece."
- "The first system with real self-improvement compounds. That's the moat."

---

## SLIDE 10: The Ask

**Visual:** Numbers + breakdown

**Content:**
- **Raising:** $500K (Close A) → $1.5M (Close B)
- **Terms:** Post-Money SAFE, $5M cap
- **Use:** Founder + 2 engineers + compute | 12 months
- **Milestones:** Self-improvement → Domain mastery → Autonomous product/service

**Key talking points:**
- "Raising $500K on a $5M post-money SAFE. That's 10% of the company."
- "Here's exactly where it goes: me full-time, two senior engineers, aggressive compute."
- "Looking for investors who see the opportunity in autonomous companies."

## DELIVERY TIPS

**Demo > Deck:** Working prototype beats polished slides.

**Be Ready to Ditch the Deck:** Practice pitching without slides. Many angels prefer conversation.

**Don't Try to "Impress":** No magic words. Plain language. Best pitches don't feel like pitches.

**During the Pitch:**
- 15-20 minutes with demo
- Demo in middle (slide 5) to break up talking
- Leave 10+ minutes for Q&A
- Close: "Looking for investors who see the opportunity. Questions?"
