# Quick Objection Responses

Use during calls. Keep responses under 30 seconds.

---

## "This is just RPA / automation"

**Response:** "RPA follows rigid scripts—if something unexpected happens, it breaks. Proto reasons through problems. When a page changes or a task fails, Proto figures out what to do next. That's the difference between automation and autonomy."

---

## "Why not just use Claude/ChatGPT directly?"

**Response:** "You can use Claude to help you do a task. You can't use Claude to run your business while you sleep. Proto orchestrates specialist agents across multiple computers for hours or days. It's the difference between a calculator and an accountant."

---

## "What if the AI makes mistakes?"

**Response:** "It will—that's why we have approval gates for anything that spends money, publishes, or trades. Plus audit logs and a kill switch. We're building for trust, not YOLO."

---

## "This is too risky"

**Response:** "The downside is limited. Even if full autonomy takes longer, we can do hybrid human+AI operations, automate subsets of business processes, or spin off domain-specific agents as products. The downside isn't zero—it's a different kind of success. And agents aren't maximized yet—there's so much untapped potential. Self-improvement is the key."

---

## "Aren't you just riding the AI hype?"

**Response:** "I built this before the hype. Look at the architecture: specialist agents, multi-computer orchestration, self-improvement systems. This isn't a wrapper on ChatGPT. This is infrastructure for autonomous companies."

---

## "Why would anyone pay for this?"

**Response:** "We're not selling Proto. We're using it to run businesses—whatever works fastest. Could be agency work, content, e-commerce, trading, SaaS. The customer is the business Proto runs, not a SaaS buyer."

---

## "Why not pick one business to focus on?"

**Response:** "We don't know which will work fastest. Proto experiments across multiple paths—agency work, e-commerce, trading, SaaS, freelance—and doubles down on what works. The first business is proof of concept. The goal is a portfolio."

---

## "This is too early / speculative"

**Response:** "The architecture is built. What's left is reliability—an engineering problem, not a research breakthrough. And there's massive attention and resources flowing into AI agents right now—billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month. The reliability problem will be solved. The question is who's positioned to capture value when it does."

---

## "It's not fully autonomous yet"

**Response:** "The goal is to automate any human labor. When that's not possible, Proto uses hybrid models—it can hire people, delegate to humans, use humans as reviewers. A trading operation might be fully automated. A creative agency might have AI managing human designers. Whatever model fits the task."

---

## "Why you?"

**Response:** "I built this entire system solo—backend, frontend, specialist agents, multi-computer orchestration, self-improvement. First-principles approach: I started with the end goal—AI that self-improves and runs companies—then broke it down into components and built each one. Not a wrapper on existing tools. Purpose-built from the ground up. Not many people can see this vision AND ship it. I've been doing both."

---

## "What if OpenAI/Anthropic just does this?"

**Response:** "They could—but they haven't. They're building models, not operating businesses. They want to sell picks and shovels to millions of developers. I want to own the gold mines. And once Proto starts self-improving, there's a first-mover advantage—by the time they pivot, if they do, we'll have playbooks, data, and running businesses."

---

## "There are already tons of AI agents—Devin, Cursor, Lindy..."

**Response:** "All domain-specific silos. Devin only writes code. Lindy only does sales. Zendesk AI only answers tickets. Proto does coding AND marketing AND sales AND operations—all coordinated. Plus self-improvement. No one else combines everything into a system that runs businesses."

---

## "How do you know when you've crossed the threshold?"

**Response:** "When intervention rate drops below X% on complex tasks. We track every time a human steps in. When that number goes to near-zero on repeatable business processes, we're there."

---

## "How do I know this isn't vaporware?"

**Response:** "Let me show you the demo. [Run demo.] You just saw real agents doing real work on real computers. This isn't a pitch deck—it's working software."

---

## "What's stopping someone from copying this?"

**Response:** "Time. We have specialist agents, months of iteration, and we're shipping. By the time someone replicates what we have today, we'll be running profitable businesses. The moat is execution speed."

---

## "Why raise now vs. later with more traction?"

**Response:** "Limited runway. I can either slow down or raise now to accelerate. The opportunity is time-sensitive—whoever crosses the reliability threshold first captures the market. I'm choosing speed."

---

## "What if autonomous AI gets regulated?"

**Response:** "Possible. But our controls—approval gates, audit logs, kill switches—are exactly what regulators want. We're building responsibly, not recklessly. And if regulation comes, we're better positioned than cowboys."

---

## "What's the actual first business you'll run?"

**Response:** "Whatever works fastest. Could be agency services, content, e-commerce, freelance, trading. We'll experiment across multiple paths and double down on winners. The first success proves the capability—then we scale."

---

## "What happens if you take a job?"

**Response:** "Proto is my focus. Any employment would be structured to protect time for this. But honestly—if this raise succeeds, I'm full-time on Proto. That's the point."

---

## "Why Israel? / Why not just raise in the US?"

**Response:** "Starting with Israeli angels and micro-VCs because I have network here and can move faster. Also pursuing US investors in parallel—happy to talk to anyone who gets the vision."

---

## "This sounds like science fiction"

**Response:** "Two years ago, AI writing code was science fiction. One year ago, AI using computers was science fiction. The capabilities exist now—we're just building the reliability layer to trust them. It's engineering, not fantasy."
