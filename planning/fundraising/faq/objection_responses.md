## "This is just RPA / automation"

**Response:** "RPA follows rigid scripts-if something unexpected happens, it breaks. Proto reasons through problems. When a page changes or a task fails, Proto figures out what to do next. That's the difference between automation and autonomy."

---

## "Why not just use Claude/ChatGPT directly?"

**Response:** "You can use Claude to help you do a task. You can't use Claude to run your business while you sleep. Proto orchestrates specialist agents-cross-platform, Mac and cloud Linux-for hours or days. Multi-computer orchestration is on the roadmap. It's the difference between a calculator and an accountant."

---

## "Isn't this just another AI tool?"

**Response:** "We're not competing with the software market-we're eating the labor market. Traditional software market is $600B. Labor market is $90 trillion. When AI does a $47K job for $20K/year, that's not a software sale-that's labor replacement. Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. That's 100x the market opportunity."

---

## "What's Proto's moat?"

**Response:** "Moats matter more than ever because vibe coding means anyone can copy a widget overnight. Proto's moats are structural: First, self-improvement-every business generates outcome data that labs don't have. What works, industry playbooks, performance data-that's our walled garden. Second, cross-domain coordination-no one combines coding plus marketing plus sales plus operations. Third, compounding playbooks-each business teaches Proto how to run businesses better. Labs deliver raw AI. We deliver the finished meal."

---

## "What if the AI makes mistakes?"

**Response:** "It will-Proto can run fully autonomously, but for users who want oversight, we have optional approval gates for anything that spends money, publishes, or trades. Plus audit logs and a kill switch. The controls are there for those who want them."

---

## "This is too risky"

**Response:** "The downside is limited. Even if full autonomy takes longer, we can do hybrid human+AI operations, automate subsets of business processes, or spin off domain-specific agents as products. The downside isn't zero-it's a different kind of success. And agents aren't maximized yet-there's so much untapped potential. Self-improvement is the key."

---

## "Aren't you just riding the AI hype?"

**Response:** "I built this before the hype. Look at the architecture: specialist agents, project planning system where agents follow and update task lists for complex projects, cross-platform (Mac and cloud Linux), real computer use, enterprise controls. Multi-computer orchestration and self-improvement systems are on the roadmap. This isn't a wrapper on ChatGPT. This is infrastructure for autonomous companies."

---

## "Why would anyone pay for this?"

**Response:** "We're not selling Proto. We're using it to run businesses. We'll explore different types-agency services, content, e-commerce, SaaS, freelance operations-and double down on what works. The customer is the business Proto runs, not a SaaS buyer."

---

## "Why not pick one business to focus on?"

**Response:** "We don't know which will work fastest. Proto experiments across multiple paths-agency services, e-commerce, SaaS, content, freelance-and doubles down on what works. The first business is proof of concept. The goal is a portfolio."

---

## "This is too early / speculative"

**Response:** "The architecture is built. What's left is reliability-an engineering problem, not a research breakthrough. And there's massive attention and resources flowing into AI agents right now-billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month. The reliability problem will be solved. The question is who's positioned to capture value when it does."

---

## "It's not fully autonomous yet"

**Response:** "The goal is to automate any human labor. But when a task genuinely requires human involvement, the AI will hire and delegate to humans-that's on the roadmap. It's not about being 100% without humans-it's about the AI making the decision of when humans are needed. The unlock is the right playbook and specialized agent for each situation."

---

## "Why you?"

**Response:** "I built this entire system solo-backend, frontend, specialist agents, cross-platform (Mac and cloud Linux), real computer use. First-principles approach: I started with the end goal-AI that self-improves and runs companies-then broke it down into components and built each one. Self-improvement is on the roadmap. Not a wrapper on existing tools. Purpose-built from the ground up. Not many people can see this vision AND ship it. I've been doing both."

---

## "What if OpenAI/Anthropic/Google just does this?"

**Response:** "They could-but they haven't. They're building models, not operating businesses. They want to sell picks and shovels to millions of developers. I want to own the gold mines. And here's the moat: they don't have business operation outcome data. What works for which tasks, industry playbooks, performance data-that's our walled garden. Labs deliver raw AI. Proto delivers the finished meal. By the time they pivot, if they do, we'll have data, playbooks, and running businesses they can't replicate."

---

## "Won't GPT-5 make this obsolete?"

**Response:** "Sam Altman calls this the steamroll test: what does your product provide if the model gets 100x better? Proto passes. We're not fixing model bugs-we're building orchestration and proprietary data. Better models make Proto MORE powerful, not obsolete. We're built on the assumption that models keep improving rapidly. That's our unlock, not our threat."

---

## "Why not just use ChatGPT/Claude with better prompts?"

**Response:** "Andrew Ng's research shows GPT-3.5 with an agentic loop-reflection, planning, tool use-outperforms GPT-4 in zero-shot mode on coding benchmarks. 48% versus 95%. The orchestration layer is where the value lives. A chat interface can't run multi-day autonomous operations or self-correct across complex business processes. That's what Proto does."

---

## "What about existing companies adding AI?"

**Response:** "It's easier to build an AI-first company from scratch than to retrofit AI into existing operations. Established companies face legacy systems, organizational resistance, technical debt, and cultural friction. Proto is built from the ground up for autonomous operation-no constraints, no retrofitting. We can move faster than existing companies trying to bolt AI onto their processes."

---

## "There are already tons of AI agents-Devin, Cursor, Lindy..."

**Response:** "All domain-specific silos. Devin only writes code. Lindy only does sales. Zendesk AI only answers tickets. Proto does coding AND marketing AND sales AND operations-all coordinated. Self-improvement is on the roadmap. No one else combines everything into a system that runs businesses."

---

## "How do you know when you've crossed the threshold?"

**Response:** "When intervention rate drops below X% on complex tasks. We track every time a human steps in. When that number goes to near-zero on repeatable business processes, we're there."

---

## "How do I know this isn't vaporware?"

**Response:** "Let me show you the demo. [Run demo.] You just saw real agents doing real work on real computers. This isn't a pitch deck-it's working software."

---

## "What's stopping someone from copying this?"

**Response:** "Time. We have specialist agents, months of iteration, and we're shipping. By the time someone replicates what we have today, we'll be running profitable businesses. The moat is execution speed."

---

## "Why raise now vs. later with more traction?"

**Response:** "Limited runway. I can either slow down or raise now to accelerate. The opportunity is time-sensitive-the first system to cross the reliability threshold gets a compounding advantage. Each business generates playbooks, data, and revenue while others are still building. I'm choosing speed."

---

## "What if autonomous AI gets regulated?"

**Response:** "Possible. But our controls-approval gates, audit logs, kill switches-are exactly what regulators want. We're building responsibly, not recklessly. And if regulation comes, we're better positioned than cowboys."

---

## "What's the actual first business you'll run?"

**Response:** "We'll explore different business types-agency services, content, e-commerce, freelance, SaaS products, even copying successful business models. Not just computer-based businesses either-for physical tasks, Proto hires and manages humans while AI handles everything else. We'll experiment across multiple paths and double down on what works. The first success proves the capability-then we scale to thousands of products and services."

---

## "What happens if you take a job?"

**Response:** "If this raise succeeds, I won't take a job. I'll be full-time on Proto-that's the whole point of the funding. This is what I'm building."

---

## "Why Israel? / Why not just raise in the US?"

**Response:** "Israel has a great startup ecosystem and talent, but I'm open to moving to the US. Starting with Israeli angels because I have network here and can move faster, but pursuing US investors in parallel. If the opportunity is in the US, I'll relocate."

---

## "This sounds like science fiction"

**Response:** "Two years ago, AI writing code was science fiction. One year ago, AI using computers was science fiction. The capabilities exist now-we're just building the reliability layer to trust them. It's engineering, not fantasy."
