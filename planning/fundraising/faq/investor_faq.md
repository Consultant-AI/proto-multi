# Proto Investor FAQ

## The Vision

### What is Proto?
Proto is a multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents to execute **any complex work** autonomously-automating almost all labor, spawning unlimited products and services. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), with multi-computer orchestration on the roadmap. When absolutely necessary, AI can hire humans for tasks that require it, but the goal is full automation at scale.

### What makes this different from ChatGPT/Claude/other AI tools?
Most AI tools are designed for human augmentation-one human, one AI assistant, task by task. Proto is designed for *autonomous operation*:

- **Multi-agent**: Specialist agents working together (CEO → specialists)
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Mac + cloud Linux (Ubuntu instances); multi-computer orchestration on roadmap
- **GUI control**: Takes screenshots, moves mouse, types keyboard-giving agents access to any tool a human can use on a computer
- **Multi-step**: Executes complex processes end-to-end, not single tasks
- **Self-improving (on roadmap)**: Will learn from failures, build playbooks, optimize approaches
- **Any domain**: Not limited to one type of work-can do development, content, operations, any business (hiring humans for physical tasks when needed)

ChatGPT can help you write code. Proto can build, launch, and run an entire software business.

### Why "autonomous company factory"?
Once AI agents can reliably execute complex business processes without constant supervision, the playbook changes completely:

1. Identify profitable, automatable business opportunities
2. Deploy Proto to run those businesses
3. Compound profits into more businesses
4. System improves with each business it runs

The end state isn't one product-it's the ability to manufacture unlimited businesses. A factory, not a single company.

### What businesses will Proto run?
Proto will explore different business types and experiment across multiple paths:

| Business Type | Examples |
|--------------|----------|
| AI/SaaS Products | Build and launch software |
| Content & Media | Generate content at scale |
| Agency Services | AI agents as the service, or AI + human-in-the-loop agencies |
| Domain-Specific Agents | Sell specialized AI agents for specific industries |
| Freelance Operations | Execute work on Upwork, Fiverr |
| E-commerce | Dropshipping, digital products |
| Human-in-Loop Platforms | Coordinate humans for tasks AI can't do |
| Copying Successful Models | Replicate proven businesses-unlimited labor means unlimited experiments |
| Physical/Non-Digital Businesses | For tasks requiring physical presence, Proto hires and manages humans |
| Any Business | Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI (and humans when absolutely needed) |

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. Even non-computer-based businesses can be automated by hiring humans for physical tasks while AI handles everything else.

The scope expands as AI capabilities improve. Today's impossible becomes tomorrow's automated.

The first business is proof of concept. The goal is a portfolio.

### Why do you think we're close to that threshold?

**All the components for autonomous AI systems already exist.** The pieces just need to be connected into a reliable system.

Four things have converged:

1. **Model capability**: Frontier models can reason through complex, multi-step problems
2. **Computer use**: Screenshot → analyze → action loops work reliably
3. **Tooling maturity**: MCP, function calling, and agent frameworks are production-ready
4. **Massive attention and resources**: AI agents are where the industry is focused-billions in investment, top talent, research breakthroughs happening monthly

Agentic systems are getting better every day-and this will continue throughout 2026 and beyond. The reliability gap is closing fast.

**This is not a bet on current limitations.** AI capabilities will only keep improving. We're building infrastructure for capabilities that get better every month. What's missing is reliability at scale-that's an engineering problem, not a research breakthrough.

### Aren't there already many AI agents? What's the gap?

Current AI agents are **domain-specific silos**:
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Replit, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) - only write code
- Agent-first IDEs (Google Antigravity) - focused on developer workflows
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x, Salesforce Agentforce) - only handle sales workflows
- Support agents (Zendesk AI, Intercom, Ada) - only answer tickets
- Marketing agents - only create content
- Open source (AutoGPT, SuperAGI, AgentGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph, Agent-S) - frameworks, not businesses

**What's missing:**
- **Cross-domain coordination**: No one combines coding + marketing + sales + operations into one system
- **Self-improvement**: Almost no agents learn from their failures and get better over time
- **Full autonomy goal**: Everyone else builds copilots (human augmentation), not autonomous operations

Proto is designed from the ground up to do all domains, self-improve, and work toward full autonomy.

### What about OpenAI/Anthropic/Google-won't they just build this?

They **could** build this-but they haven't. Their business model is selling API access to millions of developers, not running businesses themselves.

**The first-mover advantage is real:**
- Once Proto starts self-improving, it compounds-each business makes the system better
- By the time labs pivot (if they do), Proto will have playbooks, data, and running businesses
- They'd be starting from zero while we're generating revenue

Different game, different incentives. They want to be the platform. We want to own the gold mines.

### What about existing companies adding AI?

**It's easier to build an AI-first company from scratch than to retrofit AI into existing operations.**

Existing companies face:
- Legacy systems and processes that weren't designed for AI
- Organizational resistance and change management
- Technical debt and integration complexity
- Cultural friction between "how we've always done it" and AI-native workflows

Proto is built from the ground up for autonomous operation-no legacy constraints, no retrofitting. We can move faster than established companies trying to bolt AI onto existing processes.

### How is Proto different from other AI tools and startups?

**We're not competing with the software market-we're eating the labor market.**

Most AI tools are software that helps people do their jobs better. Proto replaces the jobs entirely. This is a fundamentally different market:
- Traditional software market: ~$600B
- Global labor market: ~$90 TRILLION

When AI can do a $47K job for $20K/year, that's not a software sale-that's labor replacement. Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. That's 100x the market opportunity.

**Value creation, not cost savings:** The successful AI labor-replacement companies (like Salient in collections) grew explosively by pitching "we collect 50% MORE revenue," not "we're cheaper than humans." Proto generates value-it doesn't just cut costs.

### What's Proto's moat? Can't anyone build this?

**Moats matter MORE than ever because AI makes building software trivially easy.**

"Vibe coding" means anyone can build a widget overnight. That's why Proto's moats are structural, not feature-based:

1. **Self-improvement (proprietary data on what works)**
   - Every business Proto runs generates outcome data that labs (OpenAI, Anthropic) don't have
   - What approaches work for which tasks, industry-specific playbooks, performance data across thousands of processes
   - This is Proto's walled garden-data labs can't access

2. **Cross-domain coordination**
   - No one else combines coding + marketing + sales + operations into one system
   - Domain silos can't replicate end-to-end business operations

3. **End-to-end workflow ownership**
   - Like Eve owns legal workflow, Proto owns business operations
   - "The best companies have hostages, not customers"-we become the system of record

4. **Compounding playbooks**
   - Each business teaches Proto how to run businesses better
   - These learnings compound with every operation

Labs deliver raw AI (vegetables). Proto delivers the finished meal.

### Won't OpenAI just steamroll you when GPT-5 comes out?

**The "steamroll test" (Sam Altman's framing):** "What does my product provide if the underlying model becomes 100x better tomorrow?"

Proto passes this test. Here's why better models help us:

1. **Our moat isn't fixing model bugs** - We're not building workarounds for GPT-4 limitations. We're building orchestration, workflows, and proprietary business operation data.

2. **Better models = better Proto** - We're built on the assumption that models keep improving rapidly. That's our unlock, not our threat. Companies that "constantly ask for the latest model and want to try it first are probably on the right track" (Altman).

3. **The orchestration layer matters more than raw model power** - Andrew Ng's research shows GPT-3.5 in an agentic loop (reflection, planning, tool use) outperforms GPT-4 in zero-shot mode on coding benchmarks. The agentic architecture IS the product.

4. **Labs don't have our data** - Every business we run generates proprietary outcome data: what works, industry playbooks, performance data across operations. Labs are building models, not running businesses.

**Bottom line:** OpenAI wants to sell picks and shovels. We want to own the gold mines.

### Why agentic workflows instead of just using ChatGPT/Claude directly?

**The proof is in the benchmarks:**
- GPT-3.5 zero-shot: ~48% on HumanEval (coding)
- GPT-3.5 with agentic loop: 95%+ on the same benchmark

**Four patterns that make the difference:**
1. **Reflection** - Agent checks its own work
2. **Tool Use** - Agent accesses external systems
3. **Planning** - Agent decomposes goals into steps
4. **Multi-agent Collaboration** - Specialists work together

Proto implements all four. A simple chat interface can't do multi-day autonomous operations, cross-platform coordination, or self-correcting business processes.

## The Product

### How does the agent system work?
Proto has **specialist agents** organized like a company:

- **C-Suite**: CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO-strategic coordination
- **Directors**: Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales-functional leadership
- **Specialists**: Developers, writers, analysts, traders, designers-execution

Each agent has optimized system prompts, tools, and knowledge for its domain. The system is a **peer-to-peer collaborative network**-any agent can delegate to any other specialist when expertise is needed.

The CEO analyzes incoming tasks, creates plans, and coordinates-but specialists work together fluidly, calling each other as needed.

### How does multi-computer control work?
Proto is cross-platform and cloud-ready:

- **Local control**: Mouse, keyboard, screenshots via direct automation (Mac)
- **Cloud Linux**: Ubuntu instances with software already installed and working
- **Cloud VMs**: Hetzner instances provisioned on demand
- **Remote access**: SSH for terminal, VNC for visual desktop control

**Built today:** Proto runs on Mac locally and cloud Linux (Ubuntu). The software is cross-platform.

**On roadmap:** Multi-computer orchestration-multiple machines working together simultaneously, coordinated through a message bus.

### What can Proto actually do today?

**Built Today:**
- **Specialist agents**: Organized like a company (C-Suite → Directors → Specialists)
- **Project planning system**: For each project, creates planning files and task lists that agents follow and update-handles big, complex projects systematically
- **File operations**: Read, write, edit, search any file type
- **Terminal**: Execute commands, run scripts, manage systems
- **GUI automation**: Screenshots → analyze → mouse/keyboard actions
- **Browser control**: Web-based tasks through real browser automation
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on Mac locally and cloud Linux (Ubuntu instances with software installed)
- **Enterprise controls**: Approval gates, audit logs, kill switch

### What's on the roadmap / What can't Proto do yet?

**Coming Next (what the funding builds):**
- **Multi-computer orchestration**: Multiple machines working together simultaneously
- **Self-improvement systems**: Evaluation per task, automatic code/playbook updates, continuous improvement
- **Hybrid human delegation**: AI hiring and managing humans for tasks that require it

**Other limitations:**
- 100% reliable execution of novel, complex tasks
- Physical tasks requiring real-world hardware

**The end goal is to automate any human labor.** When that's not possible, Proto will use hybrid models-the right playbook and specialized agent for each task. This is what we're building.

## Risk & Control

### Our Honest Position on Safety

**We don't claim to have solved AI safety.** This is risky. Autonomous AI companies are coming—if not us, someone else. We'd rather have safety-focused teams leading this space, trying to do it as responsibly as possible.

We have controls (below), but we're not claiming they make this safe. We're trying to minimize harm while acknowledging the risks are real.

### Can Proto run fully autonomously?

**Yes.** Proto can operate fully autonomously without human oversight. The enterprise controls below are **optional**-available for users who want oversight on sensitive actions, but not required.

### How do you try to limit damage?

We're not claiming we prevent all problems—we're trying to limit damage when things go wrong.

**Approval Gates (Optional)**: Users can configure Proto to pause before actions that:
- Spend money (API calls, purchases, trades)
- Publish externally (social media, websites, emails)
- Modify production systems
- Create accounts or change permissions

**Audit Log**: Every action is logged with:
- What was done
- Which agent did it
- Full diff of any changes
- Timestamp and context

**Kill Switch**: Immediate halt of all agent activity with one command.

**Rate Limits**: Maximum actions per minute, maximum spend per session.

### What if the AI hallucinates or makes errors?

**It will.** We don't claim perfection. Proto uses verification loops to catch and correct errors:
1. Execute action (e.g., write code, send email)
2. Verify result (e.g., run tests, check delivery)
3. If failure, iterate or escalate to human

But the honest answer: mistakes will happen. We're building systems to limit damage, not prevent all problems.

### Who has access to the systems Proto controls?
Only the human operator. Proto operates within the permissions granted-same as giving a contractor access. You define the boundaries.

## The Business

### Why is this a good opportunity?

**The market gap is clear:**
- Current agents are domain-specific silos (coding only, sales only, support only)
- Almost no agents self-improve and learn from their work
- Everyone builds copilots-no one is building to automate human labor entirely
- Agents aren't maximized yet-there's so much untapped potential

**The reward is enormous:**
- First system that can automate human labor at scale gets a compounding advantage
- Compounding returns: each business funds more businesses
- The prize isn't one company-it's the ability to spawn thousands of products and services
- Self-improvement is the key: each task makes Proto better at all tasks

**Why the downside is limited:**
Even if some tasks can't be fully automated, Proto can use hybrid models:
- **AI managing humans**: Proto coordinating human workers-10x productivity gains
- **Automate subsets**: Even automating 50% of a business process is valuable
- **Domain-specific agents**: Spin off specialized agents as standalone products
- **Enterprise automation**: Sell the orchestration platform to companies

**The downside isn't zero-it's a different kind of success.** Full automation is the goal. Hybrid models are the bridge.

### Why not just pick one business to focus on?

We don't know which business will work fastest. That's the point-Proto experiments across multiple paths simultaneously:
- Try agency work while testing e-commerce
- Build a SaaS product while running freelance operations
- Run freelance operations while generating content

The first successful business proves the capability. Then we scale to many businesses.

### What's the revenue model?

**Phase 1 (Now)**: Prove reliability on complex processes. Generate pilot revenue from whichever path works.

**Phase 2 (Post-raise)**: Run autonomous business operations. Proto becomes the business, not a tool for businesses.

**Phase 3 (At threshold)**: Launch portfolio of autonomous companies. Each one adds revenue and makes the system better.

This is not SaaS. We don't charge per seat. We run businesses.

### What's the market size?
The TAM for "businesses that could be automated" is effectively infinite. But we're not targeting a market-we're building infrastructure to create value across any automatable business.

If Proto can reliably run one business, it can run ten. Or a hundred. Or thousands.

## The Raise

### How much are you raising?
**Close A**: $500K (momentum round)
**Close B**: $1.5M total (after proof milestones)

### What's the use of funds?
12-month runway covering:
- Founder salary: $11,000/month
- 2 senior engineers: $22,000/month
- Aggressive compute (API tokens, cloud VMs): $5,000/month
- Overhead: $4,000/month

**Total monthly burn**: ~$42,000
**12-month need**: ~$575,000 (includes buffer)

### What are the milestones for Close B?
1. Self-improvement systems demonstrably working
2. Mastery of at least one domain-marketing campaigns, software development, or company operations running end-to-end with minimal intervention
3. Complete product or service delivered autonomously (e.g., launched SaaS product, completed client project, or revenue-generating operation)

### What's the valuation / terms?
**Post-Money SAFE** (YC standard) with **$5M cap**.

- **Close A ($500K):** $5M post-money cap → 10% dilution
- **Close B ($1.5M total):** $5M post-money cap → 30% total dilution

**Why $5M cap:**
- Working prototype (not just an idea)-the architecture is built and functional
- Solo technical founder who built the entire stack-backend, frontend, agent orchestration, cross-platform infrastructure
- Pre-seed with clear path to revenue through autonomous business operations
- Market standard for pre-seed with working software: $4M-$6M caps

**Post-Money vs. Pre-Money:**
- **Pre-money**: Company value before the investment
- **Post-money**: Company value after the investment (pre-money + investment amount)
- SAFEs are typically post-money (simpler math)

### What about dilution?
When you raise, investors get newly issued shares. Your number of shares stays the same, but your percentage decreases.

Typical founder ownership trajectory:
- After Pre-Seed: ~85-90%
- After Seed: ~70-80%
- After Series A: ~55-65%
- After Series B: ~40-50%

This is normal. A smaller percentage of a larger company is worth more than 100% of nothing.

### Why no 5-year projections?
5-year financial projections at seed stage are guesswork-it's impossible to predict that far ahead for an early-stage company.

We focus on the next **12-18 months**:
- Clear monthly burn calculation
- Specific milestones we'll hit
- What the money will be used for

If asked for projections, we provide short-term focus with honest assumptions, not made-up hockey sticks.

## The Founder

### Why are you the right person to build this?
- Built Proto's entire stack solo-backend, frontend, agent orchestration, cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux)
- Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently
- Vision + execution: I see where this goes AND I can build it

**First-principles approach:** I started with the end goal-an AI agent that self-improves and runs companies autonomously. Then I broke it down into components: What does it need to control computers? What specialist skills does it need? How does it learn from failures? How does it coordinate multiple agents? I designed and built each component to work together as a coherent system. Not a wrapper on existing tools-purpose-built from the ground up for autonomous operation.

**Resilience:** Building Proto has meant months of solo development, countless failed experiments, and moments where the whole approach seemed impossible. I kept going because I believe this is inevitable-and I want to be the one who builds it. That stubbornness is what this problem requires.

**Authenticity:** I'm not pretending this is easy or that I have all the answers. What I have is a working system, a clear vision, and the willingness to grind through the hard parts. I'm aware of my limitations-I need great engineers, I need compute resources, I need time. That's why I'm raising.

### Are you looking for co-founders?
Open to it for the right person, but not actively seeking. Need someone who believes in autonomous companies and can contribute at a senior technical or operational level.

### What's your timeline?
- **Now**: Fundraising + proving complex process execution
- **Months 1-6**: Team + reliability improvements + business experiments
- **Months 6-12**: Scale operations, decrease intervention rate, portfolio growth
