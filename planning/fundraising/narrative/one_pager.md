# Proto: The Autonomous Company Factory

## The Insight

**Software is eating labor.** The labor market ($90T) is 100x bigger than the software market ($600B). AI will run entire businesses-not just tasks, entire companies. The first system to reliably do this becomes a compounding money machine.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

## What Proto Is

Multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents to run businesses autonomously.

**Built today:** Specialist agents organized like a company (C-Suite → Directors → Specialists). Project planning system. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux). Real computer use-files, terminal, GUI automation, browser. Optional enterprise controls.

**On roadmap:** Multi-computer orchestration. Self-improvement systems. Hybrid human delegation (AI hiring humans when needed).

## The Business Model

Proto is not SaaS. **We run businesses.**

Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. SaaS products, agencies, content, e-commerce, freelance operations. First business = proof of concept. Endgame = portfolio of autonomous companies.

Each business generates revenue AND data that makes Proto better. That's the compounding effect.

## Why Now

All components exist: model capability, computer use, orchestration frameworks. AI improves every month. The industry moved to production (40% of enterprise apps have agents)-but all domain silos. No one combines everything with self-improvement.

**The gap:** Cross-domain coordination + self-improvement + full autonomy goal.

## The Raise

**$500K** (Close A) → **$1.5M** total (Close B) | **$5M post-money SAFE cap**

**Use:** Founder + 2 senior engineers + aggressive compute | 12 months

**Milestones:** Self-improvement working → Domain mastery → Complete product/service delivered autonomously
