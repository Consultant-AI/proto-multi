# Proto: The Autonomous Company Factory

## The Opportunity

**Autonomous companies are inevitable.**

Software will run entire businesses—not just tasks. We're 12–24 months from a capability threshold where AI agents can reliably execute complex, multi-step business processes without constant human supervision.

**Why now:** Four things have converged—model capability, computer use, tooling maturity, and massive attention and resources. AI agents are where the industry is focused: billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month. The reliability problem will be solved. The question is who's positioned first.

Once that threshold is crossed, the first system that can reliably run businesses becomes a **compounding money machine**—spawning and operating multiple companies simultaneously, self-improving with each iteration.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

## What Proto Is

Proto is a multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents across multiple computers to execute **any complex computer-based work** autonomously.

**The Architecture (Built Today):**

- **Specialist Agents** organized like a company—C-Suite for strategic coordination, Directors for functional leadership, Specialists for execution. Any agent can call any other specialist when expertise is needed.

- **Multi-Computer Control**—local machines, remote servers via SSH/VNC, and cloud VMs (Hetzner). All coordinated through a single interface.

- **Real Tools**—file operations, terminal commands, GUI automation (screenshots, mouse, keyboard), and browser control. Not simulated—actual computer use.

- **Self-Improvement**—automatically captures learnings from every task, retrieves relevant knowledge for new work, improves approaches over time.

- **Enterprise Controls**—approval gates for sensitive actions, audit logs for everything, kill switch for emergencies.

**The architecture is functional and continuously improving.** What remains is crossing the reliability threshold.

## The Business Model

Proto is not a SaaS product. **It's an autonomous company factory.**

Once reliability is proven, Proto will identify the fastest path to revenue from **any business that can be run on a computer**.

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed). Not just service businesses—any computer-based business that relies on human labor can be run by Proto:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **AI/SaaS Products** | Build and launch software products |
| **Content & Media** | AI-generated content at scale |
| **Agency Services** | Marketing, development, automation—any service |
| **Domain-Specific Agents** | Sell specialized AI agents for specific industries |
| **Freelance Operations** | Execute freelance work across platforms |
| **E-commerce** | Dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| **Trading & Arbitrage** | Algorithmic trading, market inefficiencies |
| **Human-in-Loop Platforms** | Coordinate humans for tasks AI can't do yet |
| **Service Businesses** | Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed) |

The scope expands as AI capabilities improve. Today's impossible becomes tomorrow's automated. Proto is built to grow with the technology.

Proto analyzes opportunities, picks winners, and executes. Each business generates revenue AND data that makes Proto better. The system self-improves and compounds.

**The first business is just proof of concept.** The endgame is a portfolio of autonomous companies.

## The Hybrid Model

**The end goal: automate any human labor.**

When full automation isn't possible (yet), Proto uses hybrid models—whatever configuration fits the task:

- **AI does everything**: Fully automated workflows where AI handles end-to-end
- **AI hires people**: Proto can recruit, onboard, and manage human workers for tasks it can't do
- **AI delegates to humans**: Break down complex work, assign pieces to people, synthesize results
- **Humans as reviewers**: AI executes, humans approve or course-correct
- **Humans for key decisions**: AI prepares options and context, humans make strategic calls

**It's not a ladder—it's different models for different needs.** A trading operation might be fully automated. A creative agency might have AI managing human designers. A consulting firm might have AI doing analysis while humans present to clients.

Proto adapts to whatever works. The goal is maximum value with minimum human labor—not a fixed progression.

## The Market Gap

**Current AI agents are domain-specific silos:**
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Claude Code) — only write code
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x) — only handle sales
- Support agents (Zendesk AI) — only answer tickets
- Open source (AutoGPT, CrewAI) — frameworks, not businesses

**What's missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination (coding + marketing + sales + operations)
- Self-improvement (agents don't learn from failures and get better)
- Full autonomy goal (everyone builds copilots, not autonomous operations)

**The opportunity:** Agents aren't maximized yet. Self-improvement is the key—each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's compounding.

**Why the downside is limited:**
Even if full autonomy takes longer, there's still value: hybrid human+AI operations (10x productivity), automate subsets of processes, spin off domain agents as products. **The downside isn't zero—it's a different kind of success.**

## The Raise

**Close A:** $300–500K (momentum)
**Close B:** $1–2M total (proof milestones)

**Use of funds (12 months):**
- Founder + 2 senior engineers
- Aggressive compute budget (tokens, VMs)
- First autonomous business experiments

**Milestones:**
- Self-improvement systems demonstrably working
- Mastery of at least one domain (end-to-end execution with minimal intervention)
- Complete product or service delivered autonomously

## The Founder

Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently. Built Proto's entire stack solo—backend, frontend, agent orchestration, multi-computer control, self-improvement systems.

**First-principles approach:** I started with the end goal—an AI agent that self-improves and runs companies autonomously. Then I broke it down into components: What does it need to control computers? What specialist skills does it need? How does it learn from failures? How does it coordinate multiple agents? I designed and built each component to work together as a coherent system. Not a wrapper on existing tools—purpose-built from the ground up for autonomous operation.

Looking for investors who see the opportunity:
- Autonomous companies are inevitable
- The timing is now
- The first system with real self-improvement compounds—every business makes it better
