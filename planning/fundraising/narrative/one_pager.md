# Proto: The Autonomous Company Factory

## The Opportunity

**Autonomous companies are inevitable.**

AI systems will run entire businesses—automating almost all labor, spawning unlimited products and services. When absolutely necessary, AI can hire humans for tasks that require it, but the goal is full automation at scale.

We believe there's a high chance we're 12–24 months from a capability threshold where AI agents can reliably execute complex, multi-step business processes autonomously. Agentic systems are getting better every day—and this will continue throughout 2026 and beyond.

**Why now:** Four things have converged—model capability, computer use, tooling maturity, and massive attention and resources. AI agents are where the industry is focused: billions in investment, top talent, breakthroughs every month. The reliability problem will be solved. The question is who's positioned first.

Once that threshold is crossed, the first system that can reliably run businesses becomes a **compounding money machine**—capable of spawning and operating thousands of products and services simultaneously, self-improving with each iteration.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

## What Proto Is

Proto is a multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents to execute **any complex work** autonomously. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), with multi-computer orchestration on the roadmap.

**The Architecture (Built Today):**

- **Specialist Agents** organized like a company—C-Suite for strategic coordination, Directors for functional leadership, Specialists for execution. Any agent can call any other specialist when expertise is needed.

- **Project Planning System**—for each project, Proto creates planning files and task lists that agents follow and update. This enables complex, multi-step projects to be broken down, tracked, and executed systematically.

- **Cross-Platform & Cloud-Ready**—runs on Mac locally and cloud Linux (Ubuntu instances with software installed). Cloud VMs (Hetzner) provisioned on demand. Multi-computer orchestration (multiple machines working together simultaneously) on roadmap.

- **Real Tools**—file operations, terminal commands, GUI control (screenshots, mouse, keyboard) giving agents access to any tool a human can use, and browser control. Not simulated—actual computer use.

- **Enterprise Controls (Optional)**—Proto can run fully autonomously. Optional approval gates for sensitive actions, audit logs for everything, kill switch for emergencies.

**On Roadmap:**
- **Multi-computer orchestration**—multiple machines working together simultaneously
- **Self-improvement systems**—evaluation per task, automatic code/playbook updates, continuous improvement
- **Hybrid human delegation**—AI hiring and managing humans for tasks that require it

**The architecture is functional.** What remains is crossing the reliability threshold.

## The Business Model

Proto is not a SaaS product. **It's an autonomous company factory.**

Once reliability is proven, Proto will identify the fastest path to revenue from **any business**.

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **AI/SaaS Products** | Build and launch software products |
| **Content & Media** | AI-generated content at scale |
| **Agency Services** | AI agents as the service, or AI + human-in-the-loop agencies |
| **Domain-Specific Agents** | Sell specialized AI agents for specific industries |
| **Freelance Operations** | Execute freelance work across platforms |
| **E-commerce** | Dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| **Human-in-Loop Platforms** | Coordinate humans for tasks AI can't do yet |
| **Copying Successful Models** | Replicate proven businesses—unlimited labor means unlimited experiments |
| **Physical/Non-Digital Businesses** | For tasks requiring physical presence, Proto hires and manages humans |
| **Any Business** | Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when absolutely needed) |

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI instead. Even non-computer-based businesses can be automated by hiring humans for physical tasks while AI handles everything else.

The scope expands as AI capabilities improve. Today's impossible becomes tomorrow's automated. Proto is built to grow with the technology.

Proto analyzes opportunities, picks winners, and executes. Each business generates revenue AND data that makes Proto better. The system self-improves and compounds.

**The first business is just proof of concept.** The endgame is a portfolio of autonomous companies.

## The Hybrid Model (On Roadmap)

**The end goal: automate almost all human labor.**

For the rare cases where full automation isn't possible, Proto will use hybrid models:

- **AI does everything**: Fully automated workflows where AI handles end-to-end
- **AI hires people**: Proto recruits, onboards, and manages human workers for tasks it can't do
- **AI delegates to humans**: Break down complex work, assign pieces to people, synthesize results
- **Humans as reviewers**: AI executes, humans approve or course-correct
- **Humans for key decisions**: AI prepares options and context, humans decide

Proto will adapt to whatever works. The goal is to minimize human involvement—automation first, humans only when absolutely necessary.

**This is what we're building:** The orchestration, verification, error correction, and self-improvement systems that let us deploy the right configuration for each situation. Hybrid human delegation is on the roadmap.

## The Market Gap

**Current AI agents are domain-specific silos:**
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Claude Code) — only write code
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x) — only handle sales
- Support agents (Zendesk AI) — only answer tickets
- Open source (AutoGPT, CrewAI) — frameworks, not businesses

**What's missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination (coding + marketing + sales + operations)
- Self-improvement (agents don't learn from failures and get better)
- Full autonomy goal (everyone builds copilots, not autonomous operations)

**The opportunity:** Agents aren't maximized yet. Self-improvement is the key—each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's compounding.

**AI-native advantage:** It's easier to build an AI-first company from scratch than to retrofit AI into existing operations. Established companies face legacy systems, organizational resistance, and technical debt. Proto is built from the ground up—no constraints, no retrofitting. We move faster.

**Why the downside is limited:**
Even if full autonomy takes longer, there's still value: hybrid human+AI operations (10x productivity), automate subsets of processes, spin off domain agents as products. **The downside isn't zero—it's a different kind of success.**

## The Raise

**Close A:** $500K | **$5M post-money SAFE cap** | 10% dilution
**Close B:** $1.5M total | **$5M post-money SAFE cap** | 30% total dilution

**Use of funds (12 months):**
- Founder + 2 senior engineers
- Aggressive compute budget (tokens, VMs)
- First autonomous business experiments

**Milestones:**
- Self-improvement systems demonstrably working
- Mastery of at least one domain—marketing campaigns, software development, or company operations running end-to-end with minimal intervention
- Complete product or service delivered autonomously (e.g., launched SaaS product, completed client project, or revenue-generating operation)

## The Founder: Nir Feinstein

Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently. Built Proto's entire stack solo—backend, frontend, agent orchestration, cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux).

**First-principles approach:** I started with the end goal—an AI agent that self-improves and runs companies autonomously. Then I broke it down into components: What does it need to control computers? What specialist skills does it need? How does it learn from failures? How does it coordinate multiple agents? I designed and built each component to work together as a coherent system. Not a wrapper on existing tools—purpose-built from the ground up for autonomous operation.

Looking for investors who see the opportunity:
- Autonomous companies are inevitable
- The timing is now
- The first system with real self-improvement compounds—every business makes it better
