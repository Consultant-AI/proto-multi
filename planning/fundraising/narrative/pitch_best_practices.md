# Pitch Best Practices

Based on Geoff Ralston's advice (YC Partner, "Fundraising Fundamentals")

---

## Ready, Aim, Fire

Don't "fire, aim, shoot." Have everything ready before you start asking:

1. **The Case** - Why should anyone invest? (Vision, product, opportunity)
2. **The Plan** - Who will you ask and how? (Pipeline, outreach strategy)
3. **The Numbers** - Exactly how much and for what? (Burn, runway, milestones)

If you can't articulate these clearly, you're not ready to fundraise.

---

## Be a Storyteller

**Your pitch isn't just data—it's a narrative.**

VCs meet hundreds of founders. Very few can tell a compelling story. The ones who can stand out.

### Insight Over Product
Don't lead with "we have a 100-person tech team building X." Lead with your insight—your deeper appreciation for what the problem really is.

- **Wrong:** "We built an AI agent platform with 159 specialists."
- **Right:** "Every business that hires people can be run by AI. We're 12-24 months from that threshold. Here's why we're positioned to capture it."

The product is evidence of the insight, not the point.

### Hustle as Evidence
Your "hustle" should be visible. VCs notice founders who:
- Found creative ways to get meetings
- Built impressive things with limited resources
- Showed resourcefulness before having money

The ability to make things happen with nothing is a predictor of success with resources.

---

## The Truthfulness Rule

**Two different standards for different things:**

### Vision & Future: Be Ambitious
- Your vision for where this goes can be bold, audacious, even grandiose
- "We're building the infrastructure for autonomous companies" - big claim, that's fine
- Investors want to see you think big

### Current Traction & Data: Be 100% Honest
- Never exaggerate current metrics
- Don't round up users, revenue, or milestones
- If you have 3 pilots, say 3—not "several"
- If revenue is $0, say $0

**Why this matters:**
- Investors will find out if you lied (due diligence, references, later rounds)
- Your reputation in the startup ecosystem is everything
- One lie can kill a deal and blacklist you

---

## Simple Storytelling

**The best story is usually the simplest.**

### Do:
- Explain like they're smart but not in your domain
- Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- One clear message per point
- "Show, don't tell" when possible (demo > slides)

### Don't:
- Use jargon they won't understand
- Assume they know your space deeply
- Stack multiple concepts in one sentence
- Overcomplicate to sound smart

**Test:** Can you explain Proto to a smart 12-year-old?
"It's a system that makes AI agents work together like employees at a company, so they can run a business without humans doing everything."

---

## The "Math" for Your Ask

**Know your numbers cold.**

### The Formula:
```
(Number of Employees × Cost per Employee) + Overhead = Monthly Burn
Monthly Burn × 18 months = Amount to Raise
```

### Proto's Math:
- Founder: ₪35k/month
- 2 Engineers: ₪70k/month
- Compute: ₪15k/month
- Overhead: ₪12k/month
- **Monthly burn: ₪132k (~$37k)**
- **18 months runway: ~$665k**
- **Raising: $500-600k** (with buffer)

### Be Ready to Write It Down:
"We're raising $500K. That gets us:
- Me full-time
- 2 senior engineers
- Aggressive compute budget
- 12-14 months runway to hit [milestone]"

---

## Story Structure

**Figure out your "vertebrae" first—the key points of your story.**

### Proto's Vertebrae:
1. **The Opportunity**: Autonomous companies are inevitable
2. **The Timing**: 12-24 months to threshold, massive resources flowing in
3. **What We Built**: Specialist agents + multi-computer control + self-improvement
4. **How It Works**: Show the demo
5. **The Business**: Factory that creates companies, not one product
6. **Why Me**: Built it solo, first-principles approach
7. **The Ask**: $500K for team + compute + 12 months

**Then build slides to support the story—not the other way around.**

---

## Delivery Tips

### Before the Meeting:
- Practice without slides (at least 3 times)
- Know your numbers by heart
- Prepare for the top 10 objections
- Test your demo (have a backup)

### During the Meeting:
- Energy and conviction matter as much as content
- Don't read from slides—talk to them
- Watch for engagement (if they're checking phones, change something)
- Leave time for questions (10+ minutes)

### If Tech Fails:
- Don't panic—you practiced without slides
- Tell the story conversationally
- "Let me walk you through what you would have seen..."
- Offer to send the demo video after

---

## The Ask

### Use "Would You Consider..."
The phrase "Would you consider..." is polite, opens conversation, and gives them an easy out (which ironically makes them more likely to say yes).

- "Would you consider investing at the $25K level?"
- "Would you consider joining this round?"

### Be Specific
Always ask for a specific amount. If you say "whatever you can do" or "any amount helps," you'll get the smallest possible amount.

### Ask High (Make Them Ponder)
If an investor says "yes" immediately and pulls out a checkbook, you under-asked. Ask an amount that makes them think—maybe talk to their partner or review their portfolio. That's the right level.

### Tie Dollars to Deliverables
Connect the money to tangible results:
- "Would you consider $50K? That's one senior engineer for 6 months to build out the self-improvement system."
- "$25K gets us aggressive compute for 3 months of continuous testing."

Not "we need money"—but "here's what this specific amount enables."

### Then: Silence
After the ask, **stop talking**. Count to ten in your head. Do not fill the silence with:
- "Or whatever you think is best..."
- "I know it's a lot..."
- "No pressure..."

Let them answer.

### Don't Apologize
Never say things like:
- "We aren't here to ask for money..."
- "I hate asking for this..."
- "Sorry to bring this up..."

You're offering them an opportunity to invest in something valuable—not begging.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Starting with your life story** - Start with the opportunity, not your background
2. **Reading slides verbatim** - Slides support you, you don't read them
3. **Defensive about competition** - Acknowledge competitors, explain differentiation
4. **Vague on numbers** - Know burn, runway, milestones cold
5. **Apologizing for being early** - Confidence, not apologies
6. **Talking too much** - Leave room for conversation
7. **Not having a clear ask** - End with exactly what you want

---

## Leverage Through Metrics

**The easiest way to fundraise is to have a metric that's already growing.**

### The 97% Rule
97% of the time, having an MVP with customers gives you significantly more leverage than raising on just an idea.

### Don't Raise Out of Fear
Founders often try to raise before they have metrics because they're afraid their product isn't good enough. This is a failure path. If your product isn't good, raising money won't fix it—it'll just delay the reckoning.

### Customer Obsession > Investor Obsession
Audit how you spend your time. 80-90% should be:
- Building product
- Talking to customers

If most of your time is "networking" or tweaking slides, you're doing it wrong. Investors can tell when a founder is customer-obsessed vs. investor-obsessed.

---

## There Are No Magic Words

Founders often ask: "What magic words get investment?"

**Answer: There are none.**

What actually works:
- Having built something people want
- Showing traction, not just vision
- Users, revenue, or a working prototype > future promises
- Investors invest in what exists, not what might exist

**Focus on traction:**
- "We have 100 users" beats "We'll have millions"
- A rough working demo beats a polished deck about a future product
- Show, don't tell

---

## Be Ready for Rejection

**The Whatnot story:**
- Founders were rejected by almost everyone
- Raised a fraction of what they wanted
- Company is now worth billions

**What this means:**
- Don't rewrite your entire pitch because a few investors say no
- Some investors just won't get it—that's fine
- The right investors are out there; you just need to find them
- Persistence matters more than perfection

---

## Mindset: Opportunity, Not Begging

Reframe how you think about fundraising:
- You are not asking for a personal favor
- You are not paying your mortgage
- You ARE offering them a chance to invest in something that could change the world

Write and speak as if you have a hot investment opportunity—because you do. Authenticity matters; nobody likes a phony, but confidence is not phony.

---

## Don't Be Desperate

**The founders who kept the most equity (Zuckerberg, Google founders) were never desperate when they raised.**

Why this matters:
- Desperation shows. Investors can smell it.
- Desperate founders take bad terms.
- If you NEED the money to survive, you have no leverage.

How to avoid desperation:
- Have runway before you start raising
- Be willing to walk away from bad deals
- Focus on building something valuable—that's your leverage
- If possible, be profitable (or close to it) before you raise

**The best position:** "We don't need your money, but we'd love to have you on this journey."

---

## Choose Your Heroes Wisely

**Don't emulate high-valuation unicorns with no profits.**

When planning your vision and roadmap, look at companies with $100M-$1B in actual revenue—not just high valuations.

Questions to ask:
- Are they profitable?
- Do they have real customers paying real money?
- Would this business survive if VC money disappeared?

Build a sustainable, high-revenue business—not just a high-valuation startup.

---

## Know Your Basket

Before raising, be honest about which basket your business falls into:

**Basket 1: Explosive Growth (VC-fundable)**
- High risk, high reward
- Goal: IPO or acquisition
- Spend aggressively to grow fast
- This is the ONLY basket VCs will fund

**Basket 2: Normal Business (Not VC-fundable)**
- Steady growth, founder retains control
- "Lifestyle" or legacy business
- Profitable, sustainable
- Fund with revenue, debt, or angels

**Proto is Basket 1.** The autonomous company factory thesis only makes sense with explosive growth. If we wanted steady profits, we'd just run one business—not build infrastructure to create unlimited businesses.

---

## Founder-Market Fit

Beyond product-market fit, VCs look for **founder-market fit**.

Ask yourself:
- Will I still love solving this problem in 10 years?
- Do I genuinely relate to this problem, or am I chasing opportunity?
- Am I prepared for a 10-15 year journey with potholes and shocks?

If you're just looking for "quick bucks," VCs will sense it. The best founders are on a mission, not running a startup.

**Proto's founder-market fit:** I've been obsessed with AI automation since before it was trendy. I built this solo because I believe autonomous companies are inevitable and I want to be the one who builds the infrastructure. This isn't a pivot from something else—it's the thing I'd be doing regardless.

---

## Values in Ink, Strategy in Pencil

**Core values never change. Strategy adapts.**

Internal values (ink):
- Customer obsession
- Technical excellence
- Radical honesty
- Move fast

Strategy (pencil):
- Which business to pursue first
- Pricing model
- Go-to-market approach
- Team structure

VCs want to see founders who are flexible on tactics but immovable on principles.

---

## The Work Ethic Reality

**VCs expect insane work ethic—15-18 hours a day, 7 days a week—as a precondition.**

This isn't about bragging or burning out. It's about obsession with the goal.

- If you're working normal hours, you're probably not competitive
- The best founders think about their company constantly
- This isn't sustainable forever, but it's the early-stage reality

Don't pretend otherwise in your pitch. Acknowledge the intensity.

---

*Remember: You're not begging for money. You're offering them the opportunity to invest in something you believe in. Confidence is contagious.*
