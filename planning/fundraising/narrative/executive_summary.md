# Proto: Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

**Autonomous companies are inevitable.**

AI systems will run entire businesses-automating almost all labor, spawning infinite products and services. When absolutely necessary, AI can hire humans for tasks that require it, but the goal is full automation at scale.

Our thesis: we believe there's a high chance we're 12–24 months from a **capability threshold** where AI agents can reliably execute complex, multi-step business processes autonomously. The first system to cross that threshold becomes a **compounding money machine**-capable of spawning and operating unlimited products and services simultaneously, self-improving with each iteration.

Agentic systems are getting better every day-and this will continue throughout 2026 and beyond. The reliability gap is closing fast.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

## What Proto Is

Proto is a multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents to execute **any complex computer-based work**. Cross-platform (Mac + cloud Linux), with multi-computer orchestration on the roadmap.

### Architecture (Built Today)

**Specialist Agents** organized like a company:
- C-Suite for strategic coordination (CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO)
- Directors for functional leadership (Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales)
- Specialists for execution (developers, writers, analysts, traders, designers)
- Each optimized with domain-specific prompts, tools, and knowledge

The system is a **peer-to-peer collaborative network**-any agent can delegate to any other specialist when expertise is needed. The CEO analyzes tasks, creates plans, and coordinates, but specialists work together fluidly.

**Core Tools & Capabilities:**
- **Project planning system**: For each project, Proto creates planning files and task lists that agents follow and update-enabling complex, multi-step projects to be broken down and executed systematically
- Programming (code generation, debugging, deployment)
- GUI control via screenshot → analyze → mouse/keyboard actions-giving agents access to any tool a human can use on a computer
- Integrations with third-party tools and APIs
- Playbooks for domain specialization and repeatable processes

**Cross-Platform & Cloud-Ready:**
- Runs on Mac locally and cloud Linux (Ubuntu instances with software installed)
- Cloud VMs (Hetzner) provisioned on demand
- SSH and VNC integration for remote access
- **Roadmap:** Multi-computer orchestration (multiple machines working together simultaneously) coming next

**Controls (Optional):**
Proto can run fully autonomously. These controls are available for users who want oversight:
- Approval gates for spending, publishing, trading, production changes
- Comprehensive audit logs for every action
- Kill switch for immediate halt
- Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

*We don't claim these make it safe—we're trying to limit damage. Autonomous AI is risky. We'd rather have safety-focused teams leading this space than cede it to reckless players.*

### Core Capabilities

**Real Computer Use** (not simulated):
- File system operations (read, write, edit, search)
- Terminal commands and script execution
- GUI automation (screenshots → analyze → mouse/keyboard actions)
- Browser control for web-based tasks

**The architecture is functional.** What we're building toward is reliability at scale.

**On Roadmap:**
- **Multi-computer orchestration**-multiple machines working together simultaneously
- **Self-improvement systems**-evaluation per task, automatic code/playbook updates, continuous improvement
- **Hybrid human delegation**-AI hiring and managing humans for tasks that require it

## The Business Model

Proto is not a SaaS product. **We're not selling software. We're building a company factory.**

### The Strategy

Once Proto achieves reliable autonomous operation, it will identify and execute the **fastest path to revenue** from any business:

| Business Type | How Proto Executes |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **AI/SaaS Products** | Build, launch, and iterate on software products |
| **Content & Media** | Generate and distribute content at scale |
| **Agency Services** | AI agents as the service, or AI + human-in-the-loop agencies |
| **Domain-Specific Agents** | Build and sell specialized AI agents for specific industries |
| **Freelance Operations** | Execute work across freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, etc.) |
| **E-commerce** | Run dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| **Human-in-Loop Platforms** | Build and operate platforms that coordinate humans |
| **Copying Successful Models** | Replicate proven businesses-unlimited labor means unlimited experiments |
| **Physical/Non-Digital Businesses** | For tasks requiring physical presence, Proto hires and manages humans |
| **Any Business** | Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI (and humans when absolutely needed) |

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead. Even non-computer-based businesses can be automated by hiring humans for physical tasks while AI handles everything else.

The scope expands as AI capabilities improve. Today's impossible becomes tomorrow's automated. Proto is built to grow with the technology.

### The Compounding Effect

Each business Proto runs generates:
1. **Revenue** - funds more compute and experimentation
2. **Data** - improves Proto's capabilities across all domains
3. **Playbooks** - reusable patterns for similar businesses

The system doesn't just run businesses-it **gets better at running businesses** with each iteration. This is the compounding effect that makes the opportunity enormous.

### Why Not Pick One Business?

We don't know which business will work fastest. Proto will experiment across multiple paths simultaneously:
- Try agency work while testing e-commerce
- Build a SaaS product while running freelance operations
- Run freelance operations while generating content

**The first successful business is proof of concept, not the destination.** The endgame is a portfolio of autonomous companies-potentially hundreds or thousands running simultaneously.

---

## The Hybrid Model (When Needed)

**The end goal: automate almost all human labor.**

For the rare cases where full automation isn't possible, Proto can use hybrid models:

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **AI does everything** | Fully automated workflows, end-to-end | Content generation, e-commerce operations |
| **AI hires people** | Proto recruits, onboards, and manages human workers | Creative agency with AI-managed designers |
| **AI delegates to humans** | Break down work, assign to people, synthesize results | Consulting with AI analysis, human delivery |
| **Humans as reviewers** | AI executes, humans approve or course-correct | Marketing campaigns with human sign-off |
| **Humans for key decisions** | AI prepares options and context, humans decide | Strategic pivots, major investments |

Proto adapts to whatever works. But the goal is to minimize human involvement-automation first, humans only when absolutely necessary.

**The unlock is the right playbook and a specialized, reliable agent or process.** Frontier models can already do the work. What we're building is the orchestration, verification, error correction, and self-improvement systems that let us deploy the right configuration for each situation.

## The Opportunity

### The Market: Software is Eating Labor

**Proto isn't competing with software companies. We're replacing labor.**

The labor market is astronomically bigger than the software market:
- Traditional software market: ~$600B
- Global labor market: ~$90 TRILLION
- Even replacing 1% of labor spend = massive opportunity

**What this means:** We don't compete with Salesforce or NetSuite. We compete with hiring. Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead.

**Value creation, not cost savings:** The successful AI companies aren't pitching "save money"-they're pitching "make more money." Salient (AI collections) grew explosively by pitching "we collect 50% MORE revenue," not "we're cheaper than humans." Proto generates value, it doesn't just cut costs.

### Why Now

**Compounding advantage:** The first system that starts reliably running businesses compounds with every iteration. Early movers build playbooks, data, and running revenue while others are still building.

**Compounding returns:** Each business funds more businesses. Each success makes the system better at succeeding. The growth curve is exponential.

**Unlimited upside:** The prize isn't one company-it's the ability to create unlimited companies. A factory, not a product.

### The Market Gap

**Agents aren't maximized yet.** Current AI agents are domain-specific silos that don't learn from their work:
- Coding agents only write code
- Sales agents only handle sales
- Support agents only answer tickets
- No one combines everything with self-improvement

**Self-improvement is the key:** Each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's the compounding advantage.

### Why the Downside Is Limited

Even if full autonomy takes longer than expected, there's still significant value:
- **Hybrid human+AI operations**: Proto coordinating AI agents with human workers-10x productivity gains
- **Automate subsets**: Even automating 50% of a business process is valuable and sellable
- **Domain-specific agents**: Spin off specialized agents as standalone products
- **Enterprise automation**: Sell the orchestration platform to companies

**The downside isn't zero-it's a different kind of success.** Full autonomy is the moonshot. Partial automation is still a great business.

Once we cross the threshold: We own the infrastructure for autonomous companies. Every business Proto runs is pure margin. The returns are potentially unbounded.

---

## Why Now

**All the components for autonomous AI systems already exist.** Model capability, computer use, orchestration frameworks, tooling-the pieces are all there. The challenge is connecting them into a reliable system. And AI capabilities will only keep improving-this is not a bet on current limitations, it's building infrastructure for capabilities that get better every month.

Four things have converged:

### 1. Model Capability
Frontier models can now:
- Reason through complex, multi-step problems
- Use tools and APIs effectively
- Self-correct when errors occur
- Maintain context across long tasks

### 2. Computer Use
AI can now operate real software:
- Screenshot → analyze → act loops work
- Mouse/keyboard control is reliable
- Verification confirms success
- Error recovery handles failures

### 3. Massive Attention and Resources
AI agents are where the industry is focused:
- Billions in investment flowing into agent companies
- Top talent from big labs working on agents
- Research breakthroughs happening monthly
- The reliability problem will be solved-the question is who's positioned first

### 4. The Gap in the Market
Current AI agents are **domain-specific silos**:
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Replit, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) - only write code
- Agent-first IDEs (Google Antigravity) - focused on developer workflows
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x) - only handle sales workflows
- Support agents (Zendesk AI, Intercom) - only answer tickets
- Marketing agents - only create content
- Open source (AutoGPT, SuperAGI, AgentGPT, CrewAI) - frameworks, not businesses

**What's missing:**
- **Cross-domain coordination**: No one combines coding + marketing + sales + operations into one system
- **Self-improvement**: Almost no agents learn from their failures and get better over time
- **Full autonomy goal**: Everyone else builds copilots (human augmentation), not autonomous operations

Proto is designed from the ground up to do all domains, self-improve, and work toward full autonomy.

## Competitive Landscape

The AI agent market exploded in 2025-2026. We're now in the "AI agent boom"-the definitive transition from generative models to autonomous Agentic AI. Here's the landscape (January 2026):

| Category | Key Players | Scale/Traction | Why Proto Is Different |
|----------|-------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **Enterprise Orchestration** | Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Google Vertex AI, Amazon Bedrock | Agentforce: $540M ARR (+330% YoY); Copilot now has "Computer Use" | Platform-locked silos |
| **Coding Agents** | Devin AI, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code, RooCode, Windsurf | Copilot: 20M+ users; Cursor: $500M ARR, $10B val; Claude Code: $500M ARR in 3 months | Only coding |
| **Sales/Marketing** | Robylon (40+ languages), Apollo.io (300M+ contacts), Clay, Regie.ai | Massive adoption | Only outreach/prospecting |
| **HR/Talent** | Metaview, Sloneek Intelligence, IBM AskHR | Enterprise scale | Only recruiting/HR ops |
| **Cybersecurity** | Torq Socrates (90% Tier-1 automation), Check Point Infinity, Palo Alto AIRS | "Agentic SOC" is production reality | Only security ops |
| **Healthcare** | Nuance DAX, Abridge (VA standard), Epic Factory Toolkit | Saves 1-2 hours/day per doctor | Only clinical documentation |
| **Legal** | Harvey (unicorn), CoCounsel, Spellbook, Kira Systems | 500+ legal AI tools | Only legal tasks |
| **Real Estate** | Rentberry, Ylopo, SmartZip | Full lifecycle automation | Only real estate |
| **Education** | Khanmigo, TeachBetter.ai, Curipod, NotebookLM | K-12 and tutoring | Only education |
| **Autonomous Finance** | Virtuals Protocol, Fetch.ai, Coinbase Payments MCP | Agents controlling capital directly | Only crypto/DeFi |
| **Physical AI** | Nvidia-powered humanoids (Hyundai, LG), autonomous freight | "ChatGPT moment for physical AI" | Only robotics |
| **Open Source** | LangChain (122k stars), n8n (160k stars), MetaGPT, AutoGen, CrewAI, Mastra | Massive adoption | Frameworks, not businesses |
| **Agent Infrastructure** | MCP (97M+ monthly downloads), Agent Skills (20k+ stars) | Industry standard | Infrastructure, not operations |
| **Labs** | OpenAI (GPT-5.2), Anthropic (Claude Opus 4.5), Google (Gemini 3 Pro) | Frontier models | Building models, not businesses |

**Key insight:** 40% of enterprise apps now feature autonomous task agents. But every player owns ONE vertical. The industry has moved beyond "flashy demos" into production-but all domain-specific silos.

**The Claude SDK ecosystem** shows massive infrastructure demand (MCP: 97M+ monthly downloads, donated to Linux Foundation with OpenAI/Google as co-founders), but it's all picks and shovels. Proto is the mine, not the pickaxe.

### Why Not Wait for OpenAI/Anthropic/Google?

They **could** build this-but they haven't. Their business model is selling API access to millions of developers, not running businesses themselves.

**The first-mover advantage is real:**
- Once Proto starts self-improving, it compounds-each business makes the system better
- By the time labs pivot (if they do), Proto will have playbooks, data, and running businesses
- They'd be starting from zero while we're generating revenue

Different game, different incentives. They want to be the platform. We want to own the gold mines.

### AI-Native Advantage

**It's easier to build an AI-first company from scratch than to retrofit AI into existing operations.** Established companies face legacy systems, organizational resistance, technical debt, and cultural friction. Proto is built from the ground up for autonomous operation-no legacy constraints, no retrofitting. We can move faster than existing companies trying to bolt AI onto their processes.

## The Team

### Founder: Nir Feinstein

Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently. Built Proto's entire stack solo:
- Python/FastAPI backend with agent implementations
- React/Electron frontend with multi-computer UI
- SSH tunneling, VNC integration, cloud VM provisioning
- Planning system, enterprise controls

**First-principles approach:** I started with the end goal-an AI agent that self-improves and runs companies autonomously. Then I broke it down into components: What does it need to control computers? What specialist skills does it need? How does it learn from failures? How does it coordinate multiple agents? I designed and built each component to work together as a coherent system. Not a wrapper on existing tools-purpose-built from the ground up for autonomous operation.

Not a visionary with a deck-a builder with working software.

### Planned Hires

With funding, immediately adding:
- **Senior Engineer #1**: Backend/infrastructure-reliability, scaling, orchestration
