# Proto: Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

**Autonomous companies are inevitable.** AI systems will run entire businesses-automating labor, spawning products and services at scale.

**Software is eating labor.** The labor market ($90T) is 100x bigger than the software market ($600B). Proto isn't competing with software companies-we're replacing labor. Any business that would hire people, Proto hires AI instead.

We believe we're 12-24 months from a **capability threshold** where AI agents can reliably execute complex, multi-step business processes. The first system to cross that threshold becomes a **compounding money machine**-capable of spawning and operating unlimited businesses, self-improving with each iteration.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

## What Proto Is

Multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents to execute **any complex work** autonomously.

### Built Today

- **Specialist Agents** organized like a company: C-Suite (CEO, CTO, CMO) → Directors → Specialists. Each optimized with domain-specific prompts and tools. Any agent can delegate to any specialist.

- **Project Planning System**: For each project, Proto creates planning files and task lists that agents follow and update-enabling systematic execution of complex, multi-step projects.

- **Cross-Platform & Cloud-Ready**: Mac locally + cloud Linux (Ubuntu). Cloud VMs (Hetzner) provisioned on demand.

- **Real Computer Use**: File operations, terminal commands, GUI automation (screenshots → analyze → mouse/keyboard), browser control. Not simulated-actual computer use.

- **Optional Controls**: Proto can run fully autonomously. Optional approval gates, audit logs, kill switch for users who want oversight.

### On Roadmap

- **Multi-computer orchestration**: Multiple machines working together
- **Self-improvement systems**: Evaluation per task, automatic playbook updates
- **Hybrid human delegation**: AI hiring and managing humans when needed

## The Business Model

Proto is not SaaS. **We run businesses.**

Once reliable, Proto identifies and executes the **fastest path to revenue**:

| Business Type | How Proto Executes |
|--------------|-------------------|
| AI/SaaS Products | Build, launch, iterate |
| Agency Services | AI agents as the service |
| Content & Media | Generate and distribute at scale |
| E-commerce | Dropshipping, digital products |
| Freelance Operations | Execute across platforms |
| Physical Businesses | AI manages everything; hires humans for physical tasks |

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people-Proto hires AI instead.

### The Compounding Effect

Each business Proto runs generates:
1. **Revenue** - funds more compute and experimentation
2. **Data** - improves capabilities across all domains
3. **Playbooks** - reusable patterns

The system **gets better at running businesses** with each iteration. That's the moat.

## Why Now

**All the components exist.** Model capability, computer use, orchestration frameworks, tooling-the pieces are there. AI capabilities improve every month.

**Four things have converged:**

1. **Model Capability**: Frontier models reason through complex problems, use tools, self-correct, maintain context
2. **Computer Use**: Screenshot → analyze → act works reliably
3. **Massive Resources**: Billions in investment, top talent, monthly breakthroughs
4. **The Gap**: 40% of enterprise apps have agents-but all domain silos

### The Market Gap

Current AI agents are domain-specific silos:
- Coding (Cursor, Claude Code) - only code
- Sales (Apollo, Clay) - only outreach
- Legal (Harvey) - only legal
- Security (Torq) - only SOC

**What's missing:**
- Cross-domain coordination (coding + marketing + sales + operations)
- Self-improvement (agents that learn from failures)
- Full autonomy goal (not copilots-autonomous operations)

**Self-improvement is the key.** Each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's compounding.

### Why the Downside Is Limited

Even if full autonomy takes longer:
- Hybrid human+AI operations: 10x productivity
- Automate subsets: Even 50% automation is valuable
- Domain agents: Spin off specialized agents as products

The downside isn't zero-it's a different kind of success.

## The Team

### Founder: Nir Feinstein

Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently. Built Proto's entire stack solo: Python/FastAPI backend, React/Electron frontend, agent orchestration, cloud infrastructure.

**First-principles approach:** Started with the end goal-AI that self-improves and runs companies. Broke it down into components. Built each one. Not a wrapper-purpose-built from the ground up.

### Planned Hires

With funding:
- **Senior Engineer #1**: Backend/infrastructure-reliability, scaling
- **Senior Engineer #2**: Agent/ML-self-improvement, verification

## The Raise

**Close A:** $500K | **Close B:** $1.5M total | **$5M post-money SAFE cap**

### Use of Funds (12 Months)

| Category | Monthly | 12-Month |
|----------|---------|----------|
| Founder salary | $11,000 | $130,000 |
| 2 senior engineers | $22,000 | $265,000 |
| Compute (API + VMs) | $5,000 | $60,000 |
| Overhead | $4,000 | $45,000 |
| Buffer (15%) | - | $75,000 |
| **Total** | **~$42,000** | **~$575,000** |

### Milestones (What Unlocks Close B)

1. Self-improvement systems demonstrably working
2. Mastery of at least one domain (marketing, dev, or operations) running end-to-end
3. Complete product or service delivered autonomously

---

## The Ask

Looking for investors who:
- See the opportunity in autonomous companies
- Understand the market gap and timing
- Can add value beyond capital (intros, advice, credibility)

The first system with real self-improvement compounds-every business makes it better. That's the moat.
