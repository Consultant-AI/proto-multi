# Proto: Executive Summary

## The Opportunity

**Autonomous companies are inevitable.**

AI systems will run entire businesses without constant human supervision. The question isn't "if" but "when" and "who builds it first."

Our thesis: we're 12–24 months from a **capability threshold** where AI agents can reliably execute complex, multi-step business processes autonomously. The first system to cross that threshold becomes a **compounding money machine**—capable of spawning and operating multiple businesses simultaneously, self-improving with each iteration.

**Proto is purpose-built to be that system.**

---

## What Proto Is

Proto is a multi-agent orchestration platform that coordinates specialist AI agents across multiple computers to execute **any complex computer-based work**.

### Architecture (Built Today)

**Specialist Agents** organized like a company:
- C-Suite for strategic coordination (CEO, CTO, CMO, CFO)
- Directors for functional leadership (Product, Engineering, Marketing, Sales)
- Specialists for execution (developers, writers, analysts, traders, designers)
- Each optimized with domain-specific prompts, tools, and knowledge

The system is a **peer-to-peer collaborative network**—any agent can delegate to any other specialist when expertise is needed. The CEO analyzes tasks, creates plans, and coordinates, but specialists work together fluidly.

**Multi-Computer Control** through a unified interface:
- Local machine control (mouse, keyboard, screenshots)
- Remote servers via SSH and VNC
- Cloud VMs (Hetzner) provisioned on demand
- All computers coordinated through a message bus

**Self-Improvement Systems:**
- Auto-captures learnings from every task execution
- Retrieves relevant past knowledge for new work
- Builds reusable playbooks from successes
- Generates improvement tasks from repeated failures

**Enterprise Controls:**
- Approval gates for spending, publishing, trading, production changes
- Comprehensive audit logs for every action
- Kill switch for immediate halt
- Circuit breakers and retry mechanisms

### Core Capabilities

**Real Computer Use** (not simulated):
- File system operations (read, write, edit, search)
- Terminal commands and script execution
- GUI automation (screenshots → analyze → mouse/keyboard actions)
- Browser control for web-based tasks

**The end goal is to automate any human labor.** When that's not possible, Proto uses hybrid models—hiring people, delegating tasks, using humans as reviewers.

**The architecture is functional and continuously improving.** What we're building toward is reliability at scale.

## The Business Model

Proto is not a SaaS product. **We're not selling software. We're building a company factory.**

### The Strategy

Once Proto achieves reliable autonomous operation, it will identify and execute the **fastest path to revenue** from any business that can be run on a computer:

| Business Type | How Proto Executes |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **AI/SaaS Products** | Build, launch, and iterate on software products |
| **Content & Media** | Generate and distribute content at scale |
| **Agency Services** | Marketing, development, automation—any service work |
| **Domain-Specific Agents** | Build and sell specialized AI agents for specific industries |
| **Freelance Operations** | Execute work across freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr, etc.) |
| **E-commerce** | Run dropshipping, digital products, marketplaces |
| **Trading & Arbitrage** | Algorithmic trading, market inefficiencies, arbitrage |
| **Human-in-Loop Platforms** | Build and operate platforms that coordinate humans |
| **Service Businesses** | Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed) |

**The key insight:** Any business that would hire people—Proto hires AI (and humans when needed). Not just service businesses—any computer-based business that relies on human labor can be run by Proto.

The scope expands as AI capabilities improve. Today's impossible becomes tomorrow's automated. Proto is built to grow with the technology.

### The Compounding Effect

Each business Proto runs generates:
1. **Revenue** — funds more compute and experimentation
2. **Data** — improves Proto's capabilities across all domains
3. **Playbooks** — reusable patterns for similar businesses

The system doesn't just run businesses—it **gets better at running businesses** with each iteration. This is the compounding effect that makes the opportunity enormous.

### Why Not Pick One Business?

We don't know which business will work fastest. Proto will experiment across multiple paths simultaneously:
- Try agency work while testing e-commerce
- Build a SaaS product while running freelance operations
- Explore trading while generating content

**The first successful business is proof of concept, not the destination.** The endgame is a portfolio of autonomous companies—potentially dozens or hundreds running simultaneously.

---

## The Hybrid Model

**The end goal: automate any human labor.**

When full automation isn't possible (yet), Proto uses hybrid models—whatever configuration fits the task:

| Model | How It Works | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| **AI does everything** | Fully automated workflows, end-to-end | Algorithmic trading, content generation |
| **AI hires people** | Proto recruits, onboards, and manages human workers | Creative agency with AI-managed designers |
| **AI delegates to humans** | Break down work, assign to people, synthesize results | Consulting with AI analysis, human delivery |
| **Humans as reviewers** | AI executes, humans approve or course-correct | Marketing campaigns with human sign-off |
| **Humans for key decisions** | AI prepares options and context, humans decide | Strategic pivots, major investments |

**It's not a ladder—it's different models for different needs.** A trading operation might be fully automated. A creative agency might have AI managing human designers. A consulting firm might have AI doing analysis while humans present to clients.

Proto adapts to whatever works. The goal is maximum value with minimum human labor—not a fixed progression toward "full autonomy."

**The unlock is reliability engineering.** Frontier models can already do the work. What we're building is the verification, error correction, and self-improvement systems that let us deploy the right model for each situation.

## The Opportunity

### Why Now

**Winner-take-most:** The first system that can reliably run businesses autonomously captures the entire market. There's no second place in infrastructure.

**Compounding returns:** Each business funds more businesses. Each success makes the system better at succeeding. The growth curve is exponential.

**Unlimited upside:** The prize isn't one company—it's the ability to create unlimited companies. A factory, not a product.

### The Market Gap

**Agents aren't maximized yet.** Current AI agents are domain-specific silos that don't learn from their work:
- Coding agents only write code
- Sales agents only handle sales
- Support agents only answer tickets
- No one combines everything with self-improvement

**Self-improvement is the key:** Each task makes Proto better at all tasks. That's the compounding advantage.

### Why the Downside Is Limited

Even if full autonomy takes longer than expected, there's still significant value:
- **Hybrid human+AI operations**: Proto coordinating AI agents with human workers—10x productivity gains
- **Automate subsets**: Even automating 50% of a business process is valuable and sellable
- **Domain-specific agents**: Spin off specialized agents as standalone products
- **Enterprise automation**: Sell the orchestration platform to companies

**The downside isn't zero—it's a different kind of success.** Full autonomy is the moonshot. Partial automation is still a great business.

Once we cross the threshold: We own the infrastructure for autonomous companies. Every business Proto runs is pure margin. The returns are potentially unbounded.

## Why Now

Four things have converged:

### 1. Model Capability
Frontier models can now:
- Reason through complex, multi-step problems
- Use tools and APIs effectively
- Self-correct when errors occur
- Maintain context across long tasks

### 2. Computer Use
AI can now operate real software:
- Screenshot → analyze → act loops work
- Mouse/keyboard control is reliable
- Verification confirms success
- Error recovery handles failures

### 3. Massive Attention and Resources
AI agents are where the industry is focused:
- Billions in investment flowing into agent companies
- Top talent from big labs working on agents
- Research breakthroughs happening monthly
- The reliability problem will be solved—the question is who's positioned first

### 4. The Gap in the Market
Current AI agents are **domain-specific silos**:
- Coding agents (Devin, Cursor, Replit, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex) — only write code
- Agent-first IDEs (Google Antigravity) — focused on developer workflows
- Sales agents (Lindy, 11x) — only handle sales workflows
- Support agents (Zendesk AI, Intercom) — only answer tickets
- Marketing agents — only create content
- Open source (AutoGPT, SuperAGI, AgentGPT, CrewAI) — frameworks, not businesses

**What's missing:**
- **Cross-domain coordination**: No one combines coding + marketing + sales + operations into one system
- **Self-improvement**: Almost no agents learn from their failures and get better over time
- **Full autonomy goal**: Everyone else builds copilots (human augmentation), not autonomous operations

Proto is designed from the ground up to do all domains, self-improve, and work toward full autonomy.

## Competitive Landscape

| Category | Examples | What They Do | Why Proto Is Different |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Coding Agents** | Devin, Cursor, Replit Agent, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex | Write and debug code | Only coding—can't do marketing, sales, operations |
| **Agent-First IDEs** | Google Antigravity | IDE with agent orchestration, multi-agent manager view | Focused on developer workflows, not running businesses |
| **Sales/CRM Agents** | Lindy, 11x, Salesforce Agentforce | Automate sales workflows | Only sales—can't build products or run campaigns |
| **Support Agents** | Zendesk AI, Intercom, Ada | Answer customer tickets | Only support—single domain |
| **No-Code Builders** | Relevance AI, Gumloop, Dify | Build simple workflow agents | Limited to predefined workflows, no self-improvement |
| **Open Source Frameworks** | AutoGPT, SuperAGI, AgentGPT, CrewAI, LangGraph, Agent-S | Build custom agents | Frameworks, not businesses—require development |
| **Computer Use** | Adept, Anthropic Computer Use | Control GUIs | Single-task focused, no multi-agent orchestration |
| **Labs** | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | Build foundation models | Building models, not operating businesses |

**Note:** The open source space is exploding—GitHub now has 4.3M+ AI repositories. But these are frameworks for developers to build agents, not systems that run businesses autonomously. Proto is the mine, not the pickaxe.

### Why Not Wait for OpenAI/Anthropic?

They **could** build this—but they haven't. Their business model is selling API access to millions of developers, not running businesses themselves.

**The first-mover advantage is real:**
- Once Proto starts self-improving, it compounds—each business makes the system better
- By the time labs pivot (if they do), Proto will have playbooks, data, and running businesses
- They'd be starting from zero while we're generating revenue

Different game, different incentives. They want to be the platform. We want to own the gold mines.

## The Team

### Founder

Full-stack developer who founded, developed, and released multiple apps independently. Built Proto's entire stack solo:
- Python/FastAPI backend with agent implementations
- React/Electron frontend with multi-computer UI
- SSH tunneling, VNC integration, cloud VM provisioning
- Planning system, self-improvement architecture

**First-principles approach:** I started with the end goal—an AI agent that self-improves and runs companies autonomously. Then I broke it down into components: What does it need to control computers? What specialist skills does it need? How does it learn from failures? How does it coordinate multiple agents? I designed and built each component to work together as a coherent system. Not a wrapper on existing tools—purpose-built from the ground up for autonomous operation.

Not a visionary with a deck—a builder with working software.
