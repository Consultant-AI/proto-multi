## Fundraising is a Numbers Game

**Real example from Fresh Paint (YC company):**
- Met with **160 investors**
- Got **39 checks**
- That's a 24% conversion rate—and that's considered GOOD

**What this means:**
- Prepare for volume—your tracker needs to handle 100-200+ leads
- Most will say no. This is normal.
- It's "coffee chats and Zoom calls" not one high-stakes pitch
- Don't get discouraged by rejections—it's just math

---

## Research Before Outreach

**Fundraising is 75% listening/researching, 25% talking.**

### Basic Research
1. **Portfolio Check**: What have they invested in? Look for AI, agents, infrastructure, automation
2. **Thesis/Focus**: What do they say they care about? Check their website, tweets, blog posts
3. **Stage & Check Size**: Are they actually pre-seed/seed? What's their typical check?
4. **Recent Activity**: Are they actively investing right now?

### Deeper Research (Capacity & Values)
5. **Capacity Indicators**: What suggests their check size?
   - Fund size (for VCs)
   - Other investments they've made
   - Company exits, board positions
6. **Values & Interests**: What do they genuinely care about?
   - What do they write about?
   - What causes do they support?
   - What gets them excited in interviews/podcasts?

### The 30-Second Rule
For each investor, you should be able to answer in 30 seconds:
**"Why should THIS specific person invest in Proto?"**

Not "they invest in AI" but "They led Devin's seed round, write about autonomous systems, and just tweeted about AI agents replacing entire departments."

If you can't answer this in 30 seconds, you aren't ready to meet them.

**Use research to:**
- Tailor your pitch to their interests
- Reference specific portfolio companies in cold emails ("Saw you invested in X...")
- Skip investors who clearly won't be a fit
- Fill in the "Fit Reason" column in your tracker

### Weekly Review (Monday)

1. Count by status:
   - Total pipeline
   - Calls scheduled this week

## Storytelling & Pitch Delivery

### Ready, Aim, Fire

Don't "fire, aim, shoot." Have everything ready before you start asking:

1. **The Case** - Why should anyone invest? (Vision, product, opportunity)
2. **The Plan** - Who will you ask and how? (Pipeline, outreach strategy)
3. **The Numbers** - Exactly how much and for what? (Burn, runway, milestones)

If you can't articulate these clearly, you're not ready to fundraise.

### Insight Over Product

Don't lead with "we have a 100-person tech team building X." Lead with your insight—your deeper appreciation for what the problem really is.

- **Wrong:** "We built an AI agent platform with 159 specialists."
- **Right:** "Any business that hires people can be run by AI—and when tasks absolutely require humans, the AI hires them. Even non-computer businesses. We believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from that threshold. The first system to cross it gets a compounding advantage."

The product is evidence of the insight, not the point.

### Demo > Deck

- Your product demo is your best collateral
- A rough working prototype > polished slides about a future product
- If you can show it working, show it—don't just talk about it
- The Retool founder raised his seed round without a deck—just opened his laptop and demoed

### Simple Storytelling

**Do:**
- Explain like they're smart but not in your domain
- Use concrete examples, not abstract concepts
- One clear message per point
- "Show, don't tell" when possible

**Don't:**
- Use jargon they won't understand
- Assume they know your space deeply
- Stack multiple concepts in one sentence
- Overcomplicate to sound smart

**Test:** Can you explain Proto to a smart 12-year-old?

### Know Your Numbers

**The Formula:**
```
(Number of Employees × Cost per Employee) + Overhead = Monthly Burn
Monthly Burn × 12-18 months = Amount to Raise
```

**Proto's Math:**
- Founder: $11,000/month
- 2 Engineers: $22,000/month
- Compute: $5,000/month
- Overhead: $4,000/month
- **Monthly burn: ~$42,000**
- **12 months runway: ~$500,000**

**Be ready to write it down:**
"We're raising $500K. That gets us:
- Me full-time
- 2 senior engineers
- Aggressive compute budget
- 12-14 months runway to hit [milestone]"

### Story Structure (Proto's Vertebrae)

1. **The Opportunity**: Autonomous companies are inevitable—AI runs businesses, hiring humans when needed
2. **The Timing**: We believe there's a high chance we're 12-24 months from the threshold; agentic systems improving every day
3. **What We Built**: Project planning system + programming + GUI control + integrations + playbooks (self-improvement on roadmap)
4. **How It Works**: Show the demo
5. **The Business**: Factory that spawns thousands of products and services, not one product
6. **Why Me**: Built it solo, first-principles approach
7. **The Ask**: $500K for team + compute + 12 months

**Build slides to support the story—not the other way around.**

### Delivery Tips

**Before the Meeting:**
- Practice without slides (at least 3 times)
- Know your numbers by heart
- Prepare for the top 10 objections
- Test your demo (have a backup)

**During the Meeting:**
- Energy and conviction matter as much as content
- Don't read from slides—talk to them
- Watch for engagement (if they're checking phones, change something)
- Leave time for questions (10+ minutes)

**If Tech Fails:**
- Don't panic—you practiced without slides
- Tell the story conversationally
- "Let me walk you through what you would have seen..."
- Offer to send the demo video after

---

## The Ask

### Use "Would You Consider..."

The phrase "Would you consider..." is polite, opens conversation, and gives them an easy out (which ironically makes them more likely to say yes).

- "Would you consider investing at the $25K level?"
- "Would you consider joining this round?"

### Be Specific

Always ask for a specific amount. If you say "whatever you can do" or "any amount helps," you'll get the smallest possible amount.

### Ask High (Make Them Ponder)

If an investor says "yes" immediately and pulls out a checkbook, you under-asked. Ask an amount that makes them think—maybe talk to their partner or review their portfolio.

### Tie Dollars to Deliverables

Connect the money to tangible results:
- "Would you consider $50K? That's one senior engineer for 6 months to build out the self-improvement system."
- "$25K gets us aggressive compute for 3 months of continuous testing."

Not "we need money"—but "here's what this specific amount enables."

### Then: Silence

After the ask, **stop talking**. Count to ten in your head. Do not fill the silence with:
- "Or whatever you think is best..."
- "I know it's a lot..."
- "No pressure..."

Let them answer.

### Don't Apologize

Never say things like:
- "We aren't here to ask for money..."
- "I hate asking for this..."
- "Sorry to bring this up..."

You're offering them an opportunity to invest in something valuable—not begging.

## Common Mistakes

1. **Starting with your life story** - Start with the opportunity, not your background
2. **Reading slides verbatim** - Slides support you, you don't read them
3. **Defensive about competition** - Acknowledge competitors, explain differentiation
4. **Vague on numbers** - Know burn, runway, milestones cold
5. **Apologizing for being early** - Confidence, not apologies
6. **Talking too much** - Leave room for conversation
7. **Not having a clear ask** - End with exactly what you want

---

## Handling Rejection

### There Are No Magic Words

Founders often ask: "What magic words get investment?"

**Answer: There are none.**

What actually works:
- Having built something people want
- Showing traction, not just vision
- Users, revenue, or a working prototype > future promises
- Investors invest in what exists, not what might exist

### The Whatnot Story

- Founders were rejected by almost everyone
- Raised a fraction of what they wanted
- Company is now worth billions

**What this means:**
- Don't rewrite your entire pitch because a few investors say no
- Some investors just won't get it—that's fine
- The right investors are out there; you just need to find them
- Persistence matters more than perfection

---

## Legal & Documents

### Use Standard Forms

**Use the YC Post-Money SAFE** - not custom documents.

Why standard forms:
- **Short**: 3-5 pages (not 50-page contracts)
- **Cheap**: Minimal lawyer fees (maybe just a quick review)
- **Fast**: Investors understand them immediately, no negotiation
- **Proven**: Used by thousands of startups

**Official YC SAFE documents:** https://www.ycombinator.com/documents

### Only 2 Things to Fill In

The YC SAFE is only 5 pages. You fill in:
1. **Amount** - How much they're investing
2. **Valuation Cap** - The maximum valuation for conversion

That's it. Don't overcomplicate it.

### Proto's Terms

**Post-Money SAFE with $5M cap:**
- Close A ($500K): 10% dilution
- Close B ($1.5M total): 30% total dilution

### Use Clerky for Signing

Don't email Word docs back and forth. Use Clerky: https://www.clerky.com

### READ EVERY WORD

Even with standard forms:
- Read every single word before signing
- Don't assume "standard" means "safe for you"
- Watch for modifications investors may have made
- Understand what "preferred provisions" mean

**Red flags to watch for:**
- Pro-rata rights
- MFN (Most Favored Nation) clauses
- Side letters with special terms
- Unusual valuation caps or discounts
- Board seat provisions at this stage

### Company Structure

**If you plan to raise multiple rounds, you need a C-Corp.**

LLCs are a "legal mess" for venture funding. Most Silicon Valley VCs require Delaware C Corp.

For Israeli raises: Discuss with your lawyer about Israeli Ltd vs. Delaware flip.

### Documents Checklist

**Before raising:**
- [ ] Company incorporation documents
- [ ] Cap table (clean, updated)
- [ ] IP assignment agreements

**For closing:**
- [ ] SAFE agreement (use YC template)
- [ ] Board consent (if required)
- [ ] Investor questionnaire (accredited investor verification)

### When to Get a Lawyer

**You don't need expensive lawyers for:**
- Standard SAFE
- Simple angel round

**You DO need a lawyer for:**
- Anything that's not a standard SAFE
- Priced rounds with term sheets
- Anything you don't fully understand
- Company incorporation setup

## Investor Stewardship

**The relationship doesn't end when the wire hits.**

Even investors who've committed want to feel "seen"—recognized for their belief in you.

### The Rule of Seven

Plan to thank each investor through multiple channels:

1. **Immediate thank-you email** - Personal, not templated
2. **Formal acknowledgment letter** - For their records
3. **Personal phone call** - Just to say thanks
4. **Monthly update emails** - Progress, wins, challenges (brief)
5. **Milestone celebrations** - Share wins: "We hit X, you helped make this happen"
6. **Quarterly check-ins** - Quick call or coffee
7. **Annual summary** - Where we started, where we are, where we're going

### Why This Matters

- Investors talk to other investors. Happy investors refer you.
- Future rounds are easier with existing investors who feel valued.
- If things get hard, investors who feel connected will help more.

## Mindset

### Opportunity, Not Begging

Reframe how you think about fundraising:
- You are not asking for a personal favor
- You are not paying your mortgage
- You ARE offering them a chance to invest in something that could change the world

Write and speak as if you have a hot investment opportunity—because you do.

### Don't Be Desperate

**The founders who kept the most equity (Zuckerberg, Google founders) were never desperate when they raised.**

Why this matters:
- Desperation shows. Investors can smell it.
- Desperate founders take bad terms.
- If you NEED the money to survive, you have no leverage.

How to avoid desperation:
- Have runway before you start raising
- Be willing to walk away from bad deals
- Focus on building something valuable—that's your leverage

**The best position:** "We don't need your money, but we'd love to have you on this journey."

### The Truthfulness Rule

**Two different standards:**

**Vision & Future: Be Ambitious**
- Your vision can be bold, audacious, even grandiose
- Investors want to see you think big

**Current Traction & Data: Be 100% Honest**
- Never exaggerate current metrics
- Don't round up users, revenue, or milestones
- If you have 3 pilots, say 3—not "several"
- Your reputation in the startup ecosystem is everything

### Work Ethic Reality

VCs expect insane work ethic—15-18 hours a day, 7 days a week—as a precondition.

This isn't about bragging or burning out. It's about obsession with the goal.

### Founder-Market Fit

Ask yourself:
- Will I still love solving this problem in 10 years?
- Do I genuinely relate to this problem?
- Am I prepared for a 10-15 year journey?

### Customer Obsession > Investor Obsession

80-90% of your time should be:
- Building product
- Talking to customers

If most of your time is "networking" or tweaking slides, you're doing it wrong.

### Values in Ink, Strategy in Pencil

**Core values never change:**
- Customer obsession
- Technical excellence
- Radical honesty
- Move fast

**Strategy adapts:**
- Which business to pursue first
- Pricing model
- Go-to-market approach
- Team structure

VCs want founders who are flexible on tactics but immovable on principles.

*Remember: You're not begging for money. You're offering them the opportunity to invest in something you believe in. Confidence is contagious.*
