# Multi-Computer Orchestration

**Priority:** High
**Status:** Not Started
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 days

## Objective
Enable agents to work across multiple computers simultaneously with smart task delegation.

## Requirements
- [ ] Delegation system for distributing tasks across machines
- [ ] Agent manager/orchestrator for cross-computer workflows
- [ ] Task routing based on computer capabilities
- [ ] Result aggregation from distributed agents
- [ ] Cross-computer dependency management

## Technical Details
- Orchestrator service design
- Task distribution algorithm
- Result collection and aggregation
- Network communication layer
- Failure handling and retry logic

## Task Routing Criteria
- Computer resources (CPU, RAM, GPU)
- OS type (macOS, Ubuntu, Windows)
- Agent specialization
- Current workload
- Network latency

## Deliverables
- [ ] Orchestrator service implementation
- [ ] Task routing engine
- [ ] Result aggregation system
- [ ] Cross-computer workflow manager
- [ ] Performance monitoring
