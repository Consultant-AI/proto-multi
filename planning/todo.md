### 🚧 Active Tasks

**High Priority:**

good planning and files



- [ ] System stability for autonomous operation and self-monitoring
- [ ] Real-time folder visibility as agent creates them
- [ ] Subagents calling each other directly
- [ ] Add newest models (Claude 3.7, etc.)
- [ ] Add alternative models (Gemini, GPT-4, etc.)
- [ ] Theme Overhaul - Slick, minimal, high-end design
- [ ] Computer Target Selector - Dropdown to choose computer/server
- [ ] Remote Computer Connection - SSH/API to Ubuntu servers
- [ ] Multi-Agent Single Computer - Parallel agents on one machine
- [ ] Multi-Computer Orchestration - Agents across multiple computers
- [ ] Agent Delegation System - Smart task distribution

**Medium Priority:**
- [ ] WebSocket Status Updates - Real-time multi-computer status
- [ ] Resource Monitoring - CPU, RAM, disk, network tracking
- [ ] Task Progress Tracking - Distributed task monitoring
- [ ] Error Handling & Retry - Robust failure recovery
- [ ] Multi-project orchestration enhancements
- [ ] Delegate to human, admin or other from pool

**Low Priority:**
- [ ] Computer groups/clusters for logical organization
- [ ] Load balancing across multiple computers
- [ ] Agent performance analytics per computer
- [ ] Cost tracking for cloud-hosted computers
- [ ] Automated computer provisioning and scaling

**Next Phase:**
- Architecture resilience improvements
- Agent parallelization across multiple computers
- Cloud computer control & provisioning
- Distributed agent execution
- Multi-company management system
- Marketing automation agents
- Content generation agents
- Agency services (marketing, dev, backoffice for clients)
- Advanced metrics & analytics dashboard
- ML-based pattern recognition
- Enhanced verification with visual regression testing

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Agent marketplace - download/install new specialist agents
- [ ] Kubernetes integration for auto-scaling compute resources
- [ ] Agent learning/improvement from task outcomes
- [ ] Team presets (pre-configured agent + computer combinations for common workflows)
